As you can see there are three main folders when you log in:

1. **Distributional Semantics** This is where all the code files regarding distributional semantics sessions are kept
2. **Knowledge Graphs** This is where all the code files regarding Knowledge Graph session are kept
3. **Topic Modelling**This is where all the code files regarding Topic Modelling session are kept

When you click on any folder you will find the code and data folders as shown below:
