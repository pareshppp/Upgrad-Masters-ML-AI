Pos, films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success   whether they re about superheroes   batman   superman   spawn     or geared toward kids   casper   or the arthouse crowd   ghost world     but there s never really been a comic book like from hell before    for starters   it was created by alan moore   and eddie campbell     who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid  80s with a 12 part series called the watchmen    to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd    the book   or   graphic novel     if you will   is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes    in other words   don t dismiss this film because of its source    if you can get past the whole comic book thing   you might find another stumbling block in from hell s directors   albert and allen hughes    getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in   well   anything   but riddle me this   who better to direct a film that s set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society    the ghetto in question is   of course   whitechapel in 1888 london s east end    it s a filthy   sooty place where the whores   called   unfortunates     are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision    when the first stiff turns up   copper peter godley   robbie coltrane   the world is not enough   calls in inspector frederick abberline   johnny depp   blow   to crack the case    abberline   a widower   has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium    upon arriving in whitechapel   he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly   heather graham   say it isn t so   and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can t stomach    i don t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper   so i won t go into the particulars here   other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay    in the comic   they don t bother cloaking the identity of the ripper   but screenwriters terry hayes   vertical limit   and rafael yglesias   les mis   rables   do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end    it s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because   after all   an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts    and from hell s ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days     who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star          don t worry   it ll all make sense when you see it    now onto from hell s appearance   it s certainly dark and bleak enough   and it s surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did   at times   it seems like sleepy hollow 2      the print i saw wasn t completely finished   both color and music had not been finalized   so no comments about marilyn manson     but cinematographer peter deming   don t say a word   ably captures the dreariness of victorian era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks   even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black and white comic    oscar winner martin childs    shakespeare in love   production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place    even the acting in from hell is solid   with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent    ians holm   joe gould s secret   and richardson   102 dalmatians   log in great supporting roles   but the big surprise here is graham    i cringed the first time she opened her mouth   imagining her attempt at an irish accent   but it actually wasn t half bad    the film   however   is all good    2   00   r for strong violence/gore   sexuality   language and drug content  
Pos, every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio   with every indication that it will be a stinker   and to everybody s surprise   perhaps even the studio   the film becomes a critical darling    mtv films   election   a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon   is a current example    did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened    the plot is deceptively simple    george washington carver high school is having student elections    tracy flick   reese witherspoon   is an over achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question   way   way   high    mr     m     matthew broderick     sick of the megalomaniac student   encourages paul   a popular but slow jock to run    and paul s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well   for personal reasons    the dark side of such sleeper success is that   because expectations were so low going in   the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be    you can t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews   which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have     election   a good film   does not live up to its hype    what makes  election  so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from  rushmore    released a few months earlier    the similarities are staggering    tracy flick    election    is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs   and is involved with the school play    max fischer    rushmore    is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs   and is involved with the school play    the most significant tension of  election  is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student    the most significant tension of  rushmore  is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student    tracy flick is from a single parent home   which has contributed to her drive    max fischer is from a single parent home   which has contributed to his drive    the male bumbling adult in  election    matthew broderick   pursues an extramarital affair   gets caught   and his whole life is ruined    he even gets a bee sting    the male bumbling adult in  rushmore    bill murray   pursues an extramarital affair   gets caught   and his whole life is ruined    he gets several bee stings    and so on    what happened    how is it that an individual screenplay    rushmore    and a novel    election    contain so many significant plot points   and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other   made from two different studios   from a genre   the high school geeks revenge movie   that hadn t been fully formed yet    even so   the strengths of  election  rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick   witherspoon   and newcomer jessica campbell   as paul s anti social sister   tammy    broderick here is playing the mr   rooney role from  ferris bueller    and he seems to be having the most fun he s had since then    witherspoon is a revelation    it s early in the year   it s a comedy   and teenagers have little clout   but for my money   witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination    and once campbell s character gets going   like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium   then you re won over    one thing that s been bothering me since i ve seen it    there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film    i suppose that   coming from mtv films   i should expect no less        but the film starts off light and airy   like a sitcom    as the screws tighten   and the tensions mount   alexander payne decides to add elements that   frankly   distract from the story    it is bad enough that mr   m doesn t like tracy s determination to win at all costs   but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship    even so   there s no logical reason why mr   m has an affair when he does    there s a lot to like in  election    but the plot similarities to  rushmore    and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex driven   mark this as a disappointment    
Pos, you ve got mail works alot better than it deserves to    in order to make the film a success   all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars   have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits    no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it s body   it s basically a complete re shoot of the shop around the corner   only adding a few modern twists      essentially   it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking    it s overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy   not to mention very manipulative    but oh   how enjoyable that manipulation is    but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does   because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming   sleepless in seattle    it couldn t have been the directing   because both films were helmed by the same woman    i haven t quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you ve got mail   but then again   is that really important    if you like something so much   why even question it    again   the storyline is as cliched as they come    tom hanks plays joe fox   the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley   the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family run children s book shop called   in a nice homage   the shop around the corner    fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business    little do they know   they are already in love with each other over the internet   only neither party knows the other person s true identity    the rest of the story isn t important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen    sure   there are some mildly interesting subplots   but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship    all of this   of course   leads up to the predictable climax    but as foreseeable as the ending is   it s so damn cute and well done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does    when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love   i was filled with such   for lack of a better word   happiness that for the first time all year   i actually left the theater smiling    
Pos,    jaws   is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen    the movie opens with blackness   and only distant   alien like underwater sounds    then it comes   the first ominous bars of composer john williams  now infamous score    dah dum    from there   director steven spielberg wastes no time   taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly    right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean   and once   jaws   has attacked   it never relinquishes its grip    perhaps what is most outstanding about   jaws   is how spielberg builds the movie    he works it like a theatrical production   with a first act and a second act    unlike so many modern filmmakers   he has a great deal of restraint   and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act    until then   he merely suggests its presence with creepy   subjective underwater shots and williams  music    he s building the tension bit by bit   so when it comes time for the climax   the shark s arrival is truly terrifying    he doesn t let us get bored with the imagery    the first act opens with police chief martin brody   roy scheider     a new york cop who has taken an easy   peaceful job running the police station on amity island   a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years    the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july   and the mayor   larry vaughn   murray hamilton     doesn t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money    brody is joined by matt hooper   richard dreyfuss     a young   ambitious shark expert from the marine institute    hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it    his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark     it s a perfect engine   an eating machine     make it that much more terrifying    when vaughn finally relents   hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint   robert shaw   on his decrepit boat   the orca   to search for the shark    the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark   and inevitably   are hunted by it       jaws   is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing   tension   and horror    it is like ten movies all rolled into one   and it s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975   taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time   until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by   star wars        even today   fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock s   psycho     and it never seems to age    although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences   including several mechanical sharks   obsolete   none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill    the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing   characterization   sharp editing   and creative photography   instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects    scheider   dreyfuss   and shaw were known actors at the time   jaws   was made   but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman    nevertheless   this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark    scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what s right and going against the entire town       it s your first summer here   you know     mayor vaughn warns him    dreyfuss   who had previously been seen in   american graffiti     1973   and   the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz     1974   gives a surprisingly mature   complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers    however   most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie s captain ahab   a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards    bordering of parody   shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism    he s slightly deranged   and shaw s performance is almost a caricature    however   there is one scene late in the film   when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars    quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u   s   s    indianapolis   a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese    his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1   000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair raising than anything spielberg put on screen    shaw delivers the story in one long take   and it is the best acting in the film    of course   we can t leave out the shark itself   with its black eyes   endless rows of teeth   and insatiable urge to eat   it is basically the epitome of all mankind s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature    a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real    having survived sinch the dinosaurs   great whites do exist   they can be as large as the shark in   jaws     and they are a threat    every one of spielberg s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark   a bunch of writihing   dangling   completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into    the shark in   jaws   was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks   all nicknamed   bruce   by the crew   built to be shot from different angles    many have forgotten   but   jaws   was a sort of precursor to   waterworld     1995     a movie s who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb    but   as we can see now   spielberg overcame all the obstacles   and delivered one of the finest primal scare thrillers ever to come out of hollywood    
Pos, moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post salary cap era    you ve got to know how to allocate your resources    every dollar spent on a free agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers    in the nfl   this leads to teams like the detroit lions   who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract   but can only field five guys named herb to block for him    in the movies   you end up with films like   spawn     with a huge special effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors    jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking    he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line    watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid   fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars   is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit   except that sanders doesn t have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages    but like the lions star   jackie doesn t have anybody to block for him    almost every cent that s invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts   and as chan does his own stunts   the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills    this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors   chan directs     scripts and dubbing and supporting characters   not to mention the hideous title sequence    this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain       chan s first release in this country     rumble in the bronx     was supposedly set in new york   but was filmed in vancouver   and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible      heck   jackie doesn t even have enough money for a haircut   looks like   much less a personal hairstylist    in condor   chan plays the same character he s always played   himself   a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen   a master of both kung fu and slapstick fu    jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert   and is chased by a horde of neo nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs   one of the things i like about jackie chan movies   no political correctness      he is joined by three women   who have little to do except scream     jackie   save us !     and misuse firearms    the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere   and he s more pathetic than evil    en route   we have an extended motorcycle chase scene   a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo nazis   and two confrontations with savage natives    once at the secret desert base   there is a long chop socky sequence   followed by the film s centerpiece   a wind tunnel fight that s even better than the one in face/off    this is where the money was spent   on well choreographed kung fu sequences   on giant kevlar hamster balls   on smashed up crates of bananas   and on scorpions    ignore the gaping holes in the plot   how   exactly   if the villain s legs were broken   did he escape from the secret nazi base   and why didn t he take the key with him        don t worry about the production values   or what   exactly   the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara    just go see the movie    operation condor has pretentions of being a   raiders of the lost ark   knockoff   but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him    with a lawrence kazdan screenplay   a john williams score   spielberg directing and george lucas producing   condor might be an a+ movie    however   you ve got to go with what you ve got   and what you ve got in jackie chan is something special    a talent that mainstream hollywood should   could   and ought to utilize    
Pos, on june 30   1960   a self taught   idealistic   yet pragmatic   young man became   at age 36   the first head of government of a newly independent african state   formerly the belgian congo    two months later   he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides    this little known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in   lumumba      patrice lumumba s   eriq ebouaney   story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary     lumumba   death of a prophet     virtually guaranteeing that his new   fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject    peck   with co writer pascal bonitzer   begins at the end of the story of the young political leader    we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men    images of hatchets   saws and fast emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image    jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian owned congo    a third class postal worker   lumumba   speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes   proclaiming himself not tribal   not regional   but a national leader    his small   mobile party   the congolese national movement   mnc   is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer   and get his face known   in the bustling capital   stanleyville    at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world   lumumba is in the right place at the right time and   through political savvy and chess like manipulation   achieves a position of leadership of the mnc    as the date for independence approaches   he tactically positions himself to be the new nation s first prime minister and defense minister   supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu   maka kotto      the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country s vast natural resources of copper   diamonds   gold and more    lumumba won t seek the help of the us   knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government    his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination    the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies   the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves   belgian troops violently intervene   the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe   pascal nzonzi   and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad    this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries    peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba   his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50 s and 60 s       during the time the story takes place   many new nations   including nigeria and somalia   were born   with varying degrees of success and failure   usually dependent upon which country colonized them    some colonial masters were better than others      the effort involved in   lumumba   is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades   if at all    production values are first rate on what must be a small   by us standards   budget    the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique    the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba s life    the political side of things is evenly told in a linear   straightforward manner that teaches   not preaches    it concentrates on the good deeds of the man   if a bit as a stalwart saint   but doesn t embellish on a larger than life persona    the family side of patrice s life is handled in several   perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children   embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child    i know the intent is to flesh the man out   but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba    the story   as such   has a lopsided feel about it    high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character    the actor gives a convincing   charismatic performance as the multifaceted   politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions    in true docudrama tradition   the supporting cast does not outshine the star   complementing his good efforts   instead       lumumba   is a solid   interesting   educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos   both    it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i ve seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a

Pos, apparently   director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film   american history x   i don t know the details of the fight   but it seems that he is not happy with the final product   and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether    i ve heard about this kind of thing happening before   and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce    as it is   i found american history x to be an extremely good film   not just because of tony kaye s focused look at the touchy subject of racism   but because of a powerful   charismatic performance from edward norton    it s hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton s fantastic role in primal fear   but   here he is now   starring in his own film and making himself a star    norton is one of those performers who becomes his character   and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year    he plays a young man named derek vinyard   a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother   danny   edward furlong     mother   beverly d angelo     and sister   davin   jennifer lien      the film opens with a flashback   in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car    we find out that this lands him in prison   and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny    in the present time of the film   danny is in high school   and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother    much of the film is told in flashback   and we see the path that leads to derek s adoption of white supremacy    when derek is released   having served three years in prison   he finds that his brother is now a full blown skinhead   derek   however   has given up the violence   and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things    what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid   thoughtless people    they are intelligent and articulate   and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms    it s hard to make a controversial movie and not preach   but kaye has found the right note for his material    because american history x is a mainstream film   there has to be a redemption phase for our main character    some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic    i partially disagree with this   because   although i do not advocate racism in any way   it s interesting the way kaye presents derek    he is a loud   obnoxious man   but he s also very smart    the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable    his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men    it s clear that he s passionate about his beliefs   and that he s not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up    of course   it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part    it s astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest    in addition to getting the look just right   he s perfect for this role    derek requires intelligence   depth   and a whole lot of shouting   and norton does it all with ease    even when he s at his meanest   derek has a likable quality to him   and that s a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead    what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny s school   avery brooks   becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny    the other performances are all terrific   with standouts from furlong   d angelo   and lien    visually   the film is very powerful    kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices   and most of them work nicely    lots of slow motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere    but   like a lot of movies lately   american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes    although the climactic scene is very moving   the picture ends with a pretentious   preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed    for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point   it felt like a slap in the face to be hand fed a theme in such a simplistic way    it makes me wonder what   exactly   tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film    perhaps this last scene was the problem    it s hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good    in a time when so many movies are timid and weak   american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way    
Pos, one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy s wedding    and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it    her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald   who hasn t made a worthwhile film since 1986    but the fact is   betsy s wedding is also an alan alda film    and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years   alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects   including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life    written and directed by alda   betsy s wedding is a vibrant slice of life   mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor    alda s comic elixir is smooth and refreshing  and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare    as bride and groom   molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film   but they are by far the least interesting    walsh is a nonentity   with all the screen presence of a door knob    ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain    she looks hideous with her short cropped orange hair   red lip stick and grotesque outfits    she s supposed to be a dress designer   but she looks more like a clown    and to make matters worse   ringwald s performance matches her appearance    thankfully   alda keeps ringwald s screen time to a minimum   he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters    the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride s working class   italian family and the groom s rich   gentile family    ringwald s folks are homey and down to earth   with alda as her free spirited father   madeline kahn as her practical mother   and ally sheedy as her lonely sister    walsh s clan   on the other hand   is prim   proper and ostentatious    when the two families meet and mingle   the movie becomes a story of culture clash   or as one character puts it     money versus values      ally sheedy   in a wonderfully understated performance   is one of the film s most pleasant surprises    sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body    it s anthony lapaglia   however   who seizes the spotlight    lapaglia plays stevie dee   a suave   overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old fashioned chivalry    lapaglia s sincere but dim witted character is a riot    and what s uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro   with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure    lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting   and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role model and partly a rip off    i don t know whether to say a star is born or a star is re born   but i do know that lapaglia s over the top performance should not be missed    the scrumptious comic acting   however   extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia    joe pesci   in particular   sinks his teeth into his role as alda s unscrupulous brother in law   a slum lord with mob ties   who is cheating on his wife   catherine o hara      alda   faced with challenge of both directing and acting   somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride s financially strapped father   a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet    the film adopts alda s psychological point of view as he tries to one   plan the wedding   and two   pay for it    as a filmmaker   alda s style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful    and while he doesn t have the comic genius of a woody allen   alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy    
Pos, after bloody clashes and independence won   lumumba refused to pander to the belgians   who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo    their officers   particularly general janssens   rudi delhem   in the force publique   the congo s army   caused rebellions   undermining lumumba   who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals    with unrest building   moise tshombe   pascal nzonzi   and the province of katanga   which contained 70 percent of the country s resources   proclaimed secession    lumumba replaced janssens   making mobutu a colonel   and went on a pacification  tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu   maka kotto     but it was too late     when you want to drown a dog   you say it has rabies     prophesies lumumba of his own fate    peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players   although they frequently succumb to cliche   particularly regarding lumumba s private life    peck s script illuminates bantu sayings like  the hand that gives   rules  when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador    peck s direction is less assured   with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare    he s served well   though   by his casting of ebouaney in the title role    ebouaney is dynamic   radiating his character s fierce passion for his people and his country    lumumba s intelligence and ability to strategize   even as he s cornered by insurmountable odds   are given life by ebouaney    peck s subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production       lumumba   is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney s performance makes the tragedy personally felt    
Pos, the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire fu copycats    it s not a pretty death   and it s leaving the likes of schwartznager   stallone   and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea    sometimes   the mix results in a mind blowing spectacle unlike any other    quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work   as in 1999 s the matrix   can be a real gem    but too often hollywood gets it wrong   even when they pay off chinese directors    flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists    mostly it s laughable    in hollywood s rush to emulate the success of the matrix   trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form    but iron monkey   the latest asian import   shows us how to get it right    iron monkey   actually a reissue of a 1993 film   is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante   rongguang yu     fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry    but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei hong   most recently seen in one of the most overlooked   and possibly best films of 2000   drunken master 2   released in the u   s   as the legend of drunken master      unlike drunken master 2   which stars jackie chan as an adult fei hong   iron monkey finds a much younger fei hong   sze man tsang   and his father wong kei ying   yen chi dan   thrust into the middle of iron monkey s fight against oppression    iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2   at times   fighting styles   especially that of monkey himself   do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle toed floating of films like crouching tiger   hidden dragon   director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth    iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore   kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger    however   there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters   such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good hearted but misguided enemy   chief fox    in those moments   and in others   iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience    while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2   iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune    aka siunin wong fei hung tsi titmalau    
Pos, after watching   rat race   last week   i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that   when not laughing aloud   i had held a grin for virtually all of the film s 112 minutes    saturday night   i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn t enjoy it as much the second time as the first       rat race   is a great goofy delight   a dandy mix of energetic performances   inspired sight gags and flat out silliness    hands down   this is the most fun film of the summer    the movie begins with zippy retro style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a  60s slapstick comedy   featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky jerky bodies bounding around the screen    then comes the setup    donald sinclair   john cleese     the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas   enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients    to that end   he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot

contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city   n   m     containing $2 million in cash    there is a transmitter in every key   so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead    the race has no rules   whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money    since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes   let s use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers    decked out in flashy   trashy clothing and sporting big hair   vera baker   whoopi goldberg   is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby    she finds that grown up merrill   lanai chapman   is erudite   conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life    thrown together   it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature    owen templeton   cuba gooding jr     is currently the most hated man in america    an nfl referee   he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by

 and two kids a fun filled vacation in las vegas    fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race   he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview    beverly insists the family stay together   so they hop in the mini van and tear off into the desert    brothers duane   seth green   and blaine   vince vieluf   cody are young   crooked and stupid    blaine

racer   periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr   grisham   dave thomas     his personality impaired right hand man   continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers    as with any zucker production   a few jokes fall flat   but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps    high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally   with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay off    had i been part of the filmmaking team   i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby s clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron    it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm inducing hint of child molestation    i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence    my god   do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing   all star      but enough carping       rat race   is a riot   with terrific no holds barred performances from the diverse cast    see it   see it again and when the dvd comes out   buy it   because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for    
Pos, i ve noticed something lately that i ve never thought of before    pseudo  substance   hollywood faking deep meanings in their films    have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed   then when you look back   you realize there was something missing    more and more   filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed   melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film   but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience   you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff    i m not trying to say city of angels is that bad    it had a lot going for it   but somewhere along the way   it faltered    somehow   underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all   there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography    the predictable ending that shattered our hopes   even though we saw it coming   only added to the disappointment    but for over an hour   city of angels is well worth the time    nicolas cage is seth   a guardian angel who   like hundreds   likely thousands or even millions   of other angels   spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality   humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life    meg ryan   in her most subdued performance yet   plays maggie   a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive    after losing a patient on the surgery table   these questions envelope maggie   and seth   the angel who was there to oversee the patient s transition into the afterlife   is immediately captivated by the doctor    he begins following and observing maggie   falling more and more in love with her everyday    angels   who we quickly learn are not and never were humans   can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch   but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire    seth s adoration is too much to resist   and eventually he does appear to maggie   quite regularly   although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community    the angels are interestingly presented   all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities   but it s a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness    cage is a wonderfully versatile actor   think face/off   raising arizona   and it could happen to you   what a combo !   who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once    it s nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire    the two aren t very comparable to each other   but they both deviate from her usual   intelligently ditzy   romantic comedy roles   and it s an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy    but even though the two leads do an impressive job   it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye    it s a shame that with so much going for it   city of angels falters so much in its final stages   leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there   they just didn t know quite how to get to it    they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high    filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on   remember   and convey to others thru word of mouth   so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece   they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths    based on the german film wings of desire   that being the english title   of course     city of angels is ninety percent success   enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings   even the devastatingly disappointing ending    most movie goers   the non cynics anyway   will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized    nonetheless   city of angels is beautifully captivating   which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories

Pos, synopsis   in this movie   steven spielberg   one of today s finest directors   attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque   djimon hounsou       a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery     and his fellow prisoners    cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders   but since the americans don t speak cinque s language   the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves    technically   since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time   people like cinque couldn t be kidnapped into slavery   one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave    lawyers baldwin and adams   matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins   must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery   rather than born slaves   in order to get them out of prison as free men    three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg s trademark panache     flashy beginning   lots of facial close ups   big music   and dramatic imagery    a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters    opinion   making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life    in fiction   one invents purposeful   clear cut good guys and bad guys   puts the fictional characters in conflict   and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion    real life   however   consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around   think thoughts and do nothing   or come and go before events are resolved    spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story    djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances    
Pos, the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do    lives are often at stake   and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable   prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment s notice    the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor   psychologist   and sham artist   in addition to being a police officer   he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence   or failing that   must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower    most of all   the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible   and quickly gain control of the situation   dominate the conversation   and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants    it takes a pretty smart person to do that    but what if the hostage holding criminal is just as smart    what if he s also able to think on his feet    in fact   what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor    it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f   gary gray s the negotiator    in this film   police negotiator danny roman   samuel l   jackson   is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force    when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman s home   roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder    faced with the scorn of most of the police department   and under close scrutiny by the media   roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain s office    i don t quite remember if the captain actually said     i hate to do this   but            although it wouldn t surprise me if he did    luckily   the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above    after being offered a take it or leave it deal by the district attorney   roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum   j   t    walsh     taking him and others hostage   and proclaiming he has been framed    although roman s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build up   gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian   kevin spacey   which soon ensue    jackson   while a superb actor   is miscast in the role of roman    the actor has become so popular   and so often identified as a protagonist   notable exceptions can be found   such as in jackie brown     that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats    the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence    how can we believe he s going to shoot a hostage   no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier    unfortunately   this preconception saps the film of some of it s would be suspenseful moments   and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson s acting ability    almost every time he s in a scene   jackson steals it without looking back    when spacey appears   the film has already run about a third of its course    his is an interesting character    made out to be some kind of negotiating superman   our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation       i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower   but i can t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone     he says    when he gets the call to action   however   he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be    soon   his character has to negotiate not only with roman   but also with the swat commander   david morse   who is itching to send in a team to take roman out   all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation   should negotiations fail    this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor    as the second protagonist   spacey measures up nicely    gray really lucked out with this cast    david morse as commander beck   ron rifkin as commander frost   and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent   and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey    the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices   morse played a similar role in the rock   rifkin played the d   a    in l   a   confidential   and spencer played a police detective in cop land    with the level of acting   however   this can be forgiven    also in the supporting cast   paul giamatti as rudy   one of the hostages   is notable for the comic relief he provides    his character is initially so slimy   and giamatti himself just looks so shifty   that you expect to laugh before he even says anything    fortunately   this doesn t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film   but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout    j   t   walsh   as the suspicious internal affairs inspector   clocks in with one of his final performances    sadly   the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year   and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film    walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam   backdraft   and nixon    for one of his best performances   check out sling blade   in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton    when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march   walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success   the actors performed together in a few good men      the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh   and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role   it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing    in the end   the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it s reality    we re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best    as an audience   we re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie   and we d like to see if one will dominate the film    both provide some pretty good entertainment    
Pos, plot   a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon   to whom he s devoted a tribute band in which he sings   gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place    critique   i m a sucker for movies like this    a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams   works hard   devotes the time   the energy and the patience   and ultimately hits it big time    in the case of this film   our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it   yup   luck always finds its way into these types of equations   although generally tied very closely to hard work     they need a new singer    his entry and adaptation to the whole   rock  n roll   lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch    although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love   or past love   of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it    metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn t that prominent anymore   i still check out my motley crue   twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again    that s not to say that you won t like this film if you don t like the music   but the music and live performances from the band   play a big part in the movie   and i for one   had a blast watching and listening to it all    but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg    wow   hand this fella some major props   as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god   incidentally   metal god was the film s original title   and a much better one if you ask me      he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through    he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic   who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams    aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend   and the romance angle between them was sweet     but she didn t pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes    i was also impressed by some of the   real   musicians who played in the film   zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne   jeff pilson from dokken   stephan jenkins from third eye blind   blas elias from slaughter     but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members    it s to note that this film was based on a real life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer   their original singer also admitted to being gay   as in this film      just for the record   i m certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements   since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies   but because it s a fun   uplifting   well paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances    oh yeah   and for those who dig the   heavier   side of music   the soundtrack also rocks ! !  you see       dreams  can come true        where s joblo coming from    almost famous   8/10     blow   8/10     boogie nights   9/10     detroit rock city   8/10     girlfight   6/10     goodfellas   10/10    
Pos, carry on matron is the last great carry on film in my opinion    made in 1972   it still features most of the regulars of this genre    sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit   kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting   head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac   hattie jacques re takes her role as matron   and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr   goode    the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs   with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard    this time   williams is after matron   jacques   when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr   goode    the doctor   hawtrey   is sworn to secrecy       i assure you   that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other !    bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself    there are great cameos from joan sims   an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene   and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he s at work   at the railway station      sid james  gang including cyril his son   kenneth cope   try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home    he has to share a room with nurse ball   barbara windsor   and she soon sees through him !  the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital s pills with panic ensuing    there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron   however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous  matron s     williams is   as usual   on top form   but sid james isn t given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all    the same does not go for charles hawtrey   for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time   he seems to steal every scene he is in    by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor s talent to full effect   the film seems to flounder   but it certainly makes up for it with it s good storyline and it s other appealing characters    this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored !  
Pos, the ultimate match up between good and evil     the untouchables   is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry    based on the 1959 television show of the same title     the untouchables   may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place   but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences   some excellent acting   a memorable score   and a clever script    the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public    elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order    however   as ness soon learns   in order to stabilize peace   you have to bend a few laws    the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes    the film begins with capone   played perfectly by deniro   declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws    the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl    from this point we know capone is evil   not only because he kills without hesitation   but also because he is a lying bastard    right from the first five minutes of the film   de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs    this developed hatred is before the film s hero   ness   is even introduced    i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone    the film only gets better from this point    with the formation of the untouchables   there is a group of men wearing long   dark overcoats and hats    they walk in unison and they only look forward    as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens    holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals   this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films    one that comes to mind is   the matrix   when neo   morpheus   trinity   and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world    wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930 s style   the similarities between these two are countless       the untouchables   has some of the hippest   bravest heroes in any action film    the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone s army    each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others    elliot ness   played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner   is a character that surely grows during the course of the film    he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be    however   as the film develops so does ness    his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side    he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends    his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in    sean connery   who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role   plays malone   an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables    malone acts as a mentor to ness    he teaches him   the chicago way   to do things   when they attack with a knife   you attack with a gun    connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed    andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone   a young man who is just becoming a police officer    as ness grows   he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him    charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone    smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film    the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen    also very similar to   the matrix     they are exciting and intense    >from a western like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps   the scenes are well thought out and well executed    the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement    its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors    the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective    although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified   this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting   great directing   and great action    some scenes   capone and the baseball bat   the train station   have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid    
Pos, having not seen     who framed roger rabbit   in over 10 years   and not remembering much besides that i liked it then   i decided to rent it recently    watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is    aside from the fact that it s a milestone in animation in movies   it s the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters   have them interact   and make it convincingly real   and a great entertainment it s also quite an effective comedy/mystery    while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original   especially baby herman   and watching them together is a lot of fun    the story begins in hollywood in 1947    cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work   so hard boiled private detective eddie valiant   bob hoskins   is called in by studio head r   k    maroon   alan tilvern   to try to help get roger s mind back on work    maroon thinks that roger s wife   jessica s   possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots    valiant takes some photos of jessica playing   `patty cake  with marvin acme   stubby kaye     the owner of toontown   where all of the cartoon characters live   and takes them to maroon    upon seeing them   roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect    the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town   and eventually toontown   trying to clear roger s good name    along the way they meet judge doom   christopher lloyd   a judge jury and executioner type who s out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon      `who framed roger rabbit  won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters   williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in      director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production   which included hundreds of animators    also bob hoskins  performance should be credited    he   in addition to the rest of the human cast   finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co stars    according to the internet movie database   hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off    `who framed roger rabbit  is a rare film    one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family   although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom      do yourself a favor and rent it   `p p p p please      
Pos, there s something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days    stiller currently has three projects in circulation   and what other actor can lay claim to that    he s in   there s something about mary     which i * still * haven t seen    and he s in the acerbic   your friends & neighbors     playing a talkative   sexually frustrated drama coach called jerri    now there s   permanent midnight     in which stiller plays another jerry   this one a heroin addicted television writer   last name stahl    there s also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug addiction pictures the minute they ve proved themselves commercially    ewan mcgregor springs to mind who   after successful turns in   emma   and   brassed off     received greater respect and admiration for his mind blowing realization as renton in danny boyle s transatlantic junk fest     trainspotting      the philosophy appears to be a simple one   if you want  em to be taken seriously   make  em do drugs       permanent midnight   is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl   a successful hollywood writer who   in the mid eighties   had a $5   000 a week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6   000 a week heroin habit    a habit   in stahl s own words     the size of utah      as stahl   stiller contributes a commanding performance    unlike   trainspotting     which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse     permanent midnight   instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance    one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to   naked lunch   author william s   burroughs who   when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds     so i can shave      stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in   permanent midnight     it s so he can talk to his mother on the phone   show up for work on time   even pay his bills    while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl   the writing   adapted from stahl s autobiography by director david veloz   is controlled and pointed       permanent midnight   shows how stahl moved from new york to l   a   to  again in the author s words     escape the drug scene     yeah   right     why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec   elizabeth hurley   so impossibly polite you d swear her single profanity was dubbed     and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings    stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty   norristown s own maria bello   with whom he spent some rehab time    janeane garofalo is wasted  and miscast  as a heavily bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped up wordsmith   and that s stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor    stiller   unshaven   burroughs take note   and with lots of mascara around the eyes   has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but   to his credit   never once pushes his pill popping   needle jabbing performance over the top    the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see   permanent midnight     a dark   comic   and strangely absorbing study of assisted living    
Pos, by phil curtolo mel gibson   braveheart   gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard s ransom    gibson plays tom mullen   a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath   played by gary sinise   forrest gump     and his band of low life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million    tom and his wife   kate   played by rene russo   tin cup   were instructed not to inform the police   but they contacted the fbi    minutes later   an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo   broken arrow   are in tom s house and wiring every phone    the plot sounds average   just like most other kidnap movies that you ve already seen   and it was nothing more than that    that is until about half way through the movie    suddenly   tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying     this is your ransom    but this is as close as you will ever get to it    instead   i am offering this money as a reward on your head   dead or alive      at this point   the plot thickened   and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense filled action film with great stunts    the last half of the film is very well done    another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise   as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie    owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject     it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones      before this movie   sinise played mostly   good guys     first in of mice & men   then in forrest gump   and most recently   in apollo 13    but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop gone bad    gibson   of course   was just being gibson   in an oscar worthy performance    although most of the scenes were quite predictable   ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film        
Pos, one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction    the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy   innocent fun    sometimes the stories are compelling    sometimes they re not    but   with the exception of the first film in the series   which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces     i ve never been bored by any of the enterprise s numerous missions    star trek   insurrection is no exception    the film has gotten some negative reviews   a friend of mine actually thinks it s the worst in the series     but i m not really sure why    it s an exciting   often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film    some say it s a bit too light   and more of a long episode than a film    others say the special effects are cheesy and that it s boring    i simply enjoyed the film    insurrection   which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast   introduces us to a race of people called the ba ku   the ba ku are very old   most of them are about three hundred years old     but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet    of course   these peaceful people can t horde this fountain of youth all for themselves   leave it up to their archenemies   the son a   led by ru afo   f    murray abraham     to mess everything up    the son a   who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable   strike a deal with the federation to move the ba ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying    that s when captain picard   patrick stewart   steps in   he realizes that moving the ba ku would kill them   it also helps that he falls in love with a ba ku woman   donna murphy        so   with his trusty crew   picard defies the federation to keep the ba ku in their natural habitat    when dealing with a series with as much history as this   it s not entirely necessary to re introduce your characters with each episode    this is why i believe non fans have a hard time getting into star trek   in order to enjoy it   one has to understand how to approach it    insurrection   however   does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters    stewart is bold as always   a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together    jonathan frakes   who also directed   is funny as commander riker   a subplot with data   brent spiner   discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting   and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain   overacting like crazy    frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact   insurrection is an exciting film   with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action    this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation   and the result is very pleasing to the eye   particularly in the climactic scenes   in which the son a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba ku planet   the special effects have a clean   impressively sharp look    if i have any complaint about the film   it s that it tries to take a moral stance when it s not very appropriate to do so    i don t think it s that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba ku in order to save the lives of thousands    better yet   why couldn t they have co existed    insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience    with it s inherent camp factor   the star trek series doesn t seem well equipped to deal with issues like this    i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle    
Pos, a fully loaded entertainment review   website coming in july !  >from ace ventura to truman burbank   jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic   yet sympathetic   characters    1996 s the cable guy was supposed to be his big   breakthrough   role from zany humor into darker   more dramatic acting    as most everyone knows   the results were   well   less than stellar    not only did the film not do so hot at the box office   but it was also panned by critics    as far as i know   gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it    the first time i saw the cable guy   in theatres   i was in super critic mode   and didn t really like it    however   due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day   i ve had time to lean back   relax   and take in the film    and to my surprise   it grew on me    the plot is rather simple   broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy   played by carrey   then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship    see   steven s been having some problems with his girlfriend   robin   leslie mann     and he doesn t think he has any more room in his life for a new friend    also   some of the cable guy s antics have been creeping him out    carrey   as the cable guy   gives steven various aliases   which later we find out are all tv characters   larry tate   chip douglas   ricky ricardo   etc   he apparently lives in his cable van   and while many critics didn t enjoy this newer   darker   less manic performance from carrey   i thought it was interesting and rather well done    for me   its not the movie as a whole that s enjoyable   but rather several individual scenes   a karaoke jam at steven s apartment   a medieval fight at a theme restaurant   and a bathroom beating   a la liar   liar     just to name a few    perhaps the fact that more of carrey s humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny    and if you really want to see something   you ve got to hear his version of jefferson airplane s   somebody to love     sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam    the cable guy has its bad spots   like most any movie    i didn t particularly like steven s girlfriend   and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend    also   the ending   while having you fooled for a moment   is rather contrived   and somewhat dissapointing    still   i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture   if you re at the video store and can t think of anything to rent   i suggest you try it out    or if you have hbo   just wait till it comes on   you won t have to wait long      hell   that s what i do every day    
Pos, when bulworth ended   i allowed myself a sigh of relief     it is possible for me to enjoy political satire      there have been several recent political films that didn t do a whole lot for me    wag the dog   for instance   i found to be an intelligent but heartless film   while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness      bulworth is a far better film than these   both in its execution and lasting impression      it s a tremendously funny and intelligent picture   but it also has an emotional center    writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character   and   in turn   we like him and actually care about the story        beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth   the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again      he hasn t slept in days   nor has he eaten   and   almost instantaneously   he goes insane       he s not stark raving mad   not outright   anyway     but he s definitely bonkers       it s the final weekend of his campaign   and his assistant   murphy   oliver platt   has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto       bulworth begins the speech   but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest         you mean     one lady asks     the democratic party doesn t care about the african american community           well     he shouts   laughing     isn t that obvious      the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life   he muses later that it s a bad thing to make decisions when you re suicidal     he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses   graham beckel   whom he believes to be the hitman       bulworth also meets nina   halle berry   with whom he becomes infatuated       suddenly   in the short span of this weekend   bulworth s no nonsense   truth in politics   methods become a national sensation   and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he s appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences    beatty s work on both sides of the camera is excellent      his script and direction are both extremely sharp   as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself      here is a man who s reached his limit   and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure      i like that the film doesn t take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations   but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich   although the anti rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film        some of the segments are simply hilarious   such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him      much of the film is completely absurd   but that s the fun part about it      it s an angry   serious film at the core   but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre      what adds to this feeling is beatty s portrayal of bulworth   this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale       beatty is so much fun to watch here    he s always funny   but he s also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions       beatty is so good that bulworth   despite his shortcomings as a human being   is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning    the supporting cast is vast and colorful      berry is luminous   as always   and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles      don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun toting toddlers to do his dirty work      oliver platt is an actor who should be careful   for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting   though he s very funny to watch       paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections    is bulworth offensive      i suppose some may see it that way      i wasn t offended by the film   but then again   i hardly care about politics      i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story      the film isn t perfect   of course    the ending didn t quite work for me   and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced   although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic        but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film      bulworth is a smart   uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface      
Pos, call 911 for the cliche police if you must   but the eyes are the window to the soul    the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze   paul newman   ralph fiennes   anthony hopkins   morgan freeman    you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds   that the characters they play are real human beings    we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor   but he had that unique quality in his eyes    in gridlock d   an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire   shakur and his co star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry    shakur

entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie   they are going to government offices on new year s day   in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all    gridlock d may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey   1991 s falling down   which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a

from stretch with the question     do you expect the world to stop       just  because you picked  today  to clean up      the world in gridlock d is just as frustrating as the world in falling down   but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time    hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system   but perhaps not enough of them    a significant chunk of gridlock d is devoted to spoon and stretch s flight from d reper and from the police   and those sub plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments    in one scene   stretch scares off d reper by getting chummy with a police officer   another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures    the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running   while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time    hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film s main events   perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self destructive behavior    oh   the irony of it    tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case   and living the life to back it up    in gridlock d   shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him    spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall   but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction    mostly it comes through those eyes   eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta    it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch s pure appetite   and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self destructiveness   he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again   which is as much an obstacle to spoon s goal as any agency or enemy    gridlock d s most cruelly comic scene finds stretch   helping   spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife   and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him    with friends like that   spoon doesn t need enemies   and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much    the tragedy now is that we won t get more chances to see those eyes again

Pos, for those of us who weren t yet born when the 1960 s rock  n  rolled around   monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies    from otis redding to jimi hendrix   janis joplin to the mamas and the papas   and jefferson airplane to the who   this documentary is jam packed with contagious energy    but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending   which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves    shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock   the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time    sure   some have painted their faces and smoke joints   but d   a    pennebaker   the war room   moon over broadway   surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience    no matter who is watching   it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul    the excitement starts before the music even begins    a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer   she replies that she feels lucky to do so    there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips   leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers   tries to get in touch with dionne warwick    and when one band is tuning up   a member remarks     finally   a decent sound system !    you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn t about vanity   it s about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it   a two way street    this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience    it s impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain    and while the lyrics to   wild thing   may not be all that complicated   watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love    even if you don t recognize every band you see on stage   you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats    the only drawback to the film is the ending   which unfortunately i must reveal    all the other bands   big names then and still today   got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time    in contrast   the last band on camera   a wholly forgettable one   gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time    for a film that s only 78 minutes long   that s too large of a chunk   especially when previous acts are much more stimulating    all in all   monterey pop is a precious   rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us    the variety of music   as well as the beautifully shot performances   are easy to become immersed in    if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular   this is quickly dispelled    it s almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn t get made much anymore    instead we re stuck with * nsync   the backstreet boys   and jennifer lopez   all of whom should have stuck with modeling    
Pos, the most common   and in many cases the only   complaint against francis ford coppola s 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia   which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour   loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler   kinder ages    martin scorsese   another italoamerican moviemaker   confronted that perspective with his own   more down to earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets   movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime    unfortunately for scorsese   his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola s influence on mafia portrayals in the movies    seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime    this film was goodfellas   epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s    goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story   told in best seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi   who would co write the screenplay for the film      the book   as well as the film   chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill   played by ray liotta     irish italian criminal from new york    at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero   played by paul sorvino     local mob boss   and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands    after couple of years   together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito   played by joe pesci     he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway   played by robert de niro      three of them spend years as best friends and associates   gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history    wealth   influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen   played by lorraine bracco     who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities   domestic abuse   arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business    but the perfect world of   wiseguys   gradually begins to fall apart   tommy s unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence   jimmy s reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and   finally   henry s own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends    goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory    scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker    world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating    scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence   hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime   yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny    after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history   based on some notorious real life events     the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths   trading the superficial and short lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens    scorsese also manages to break viewer s moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material   scenes that depict personal tragedies   broken homes   human depravity   violence   bloodshed and murder   in all their uncompromising reality   but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience    with the use of ironic soundtrack   manipulative shots   character s dialogue or narrator s commentary   goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era    even if we don t pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining   we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker    first   we might notice unusual structure of the plot   relatively minor subplot is used as movie s ironic prologue    then   instead of single narrator   scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards    this multiple points of views   both in terms of narration and various subjective shots   only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation    same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack    nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy listening 1950s pop songs   while depression   paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s    but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment   almost pastoral   easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed    however   thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people    such scenes   although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings   became very popular among other directors in 1990s    fragmentary character of the screenplay   which doesn t have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes   gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese    he uses this structure of film to experiment   and most successful of such experiments is hilarious   a day in life   segment near the end of the film    another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents    the most respectable among them is robert de niro   but his character   who happen to be most quiet and business like member of criminal trio   gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues    joe pesci deserved his   oscar   for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy   and his lines   including ad libs   probably represent the most memorable element of the film    ray liotta   although equally talented   perhaps doesn t look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film    liotta s henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low level street thugs    liotta   on the other hand   improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction    lorraine bracco is   on the other hand   very effective and believable as karen hill   wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband    paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso   and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave    as a combination of clever sociological study   black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do   work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time    because of this achievement   and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers   this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s    
Pos,    the blair witch project   was perhaps one of a kind   a unique film that played completely on its own merit   managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses    its success made a sequel inevitable   but this is not the sequel   i suspect   anyone much wanted    after the release of   the blair witch project     tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville   in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch    locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity   selling twig sculptures   stones and dirt like those in the movie   and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn   shouting     get out of these woods and go home !  there is no goddamned blair witch !      jeff     is one of those people   who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage    after he got released from the mental institution   he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet    as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods   on the   blair witch hunt      among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend   the pregnant tristen   who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called   the blair witch   history or hysteria       and kim   who dresses in black and has some psychic powers    the last member of the crew is erica   a young beautiful witch wannabe   who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore   saying   the first rule of wicca is   do no harm   because whatever you do will come back to you threefold      this strange group plunges into the woods   where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience    on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr s abandoned house   strange things start happening    when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain    after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies    they are somehow lost in time   as it loops uncontrollably back and forth    they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality    the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods      documentary director joe berlinger     paradice lost     helms   blair witch 2     leaving the creators of the first film   dan myrick and ed sanches   in the background    the opening scenes  the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film   is a more promising approach   because instead of trying to cover similar ground   it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand    but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story   that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue    in a way   this is a typical hollywood sequel    more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail    the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated    of course in these situations   quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values    from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody red forest   with carter burwell s     being john malkovich   and   fargo     musical score in the background   you realize that with the exception of its title   this film has absolutely nothing to do with   the blair witch project         blair witch        was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation    in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection   creating a completely different atmosphere    with its graceful cinematography   production design and flashy editing   the film has a very polished look   which is impossible to associate with the first installment    and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times   he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor    the key is simplicity       blair witch project   had a story which was incredibly simple    that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination    the film was practically an empty screen   on which we projected our most frightening nightmares    the effect was incredibly powerful   lasting and entir e everyone   but in a different way       book of shadows   feels incredibly controlled and restrict    here   very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and   clever   that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it    there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with    this is simply a less artistic film that doesn t have the talent and originality of its predecessor    it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn t always succeed    but most importantly   it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie   which doesn t allow it to destroy the original    in the end   i can t call it a bad effort    it s less artistic   not so scary and less original   but certainly not bad    it s simply different    in fact   if you haven t seen   the blair witch project     you might like this film for what it is    a cross between   the blair witch project   and the   scream    films    the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting   jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned   and incredible sense of surrealism    but it s a common knowledge and experience that   with a few exceptions   every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making    to me the story of   the blair witch project   seemed completed   but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that   the book of shadows   is certainly assured    and it s already time to look forward to   blair witch 3      
Pos, seen may 31   1999 on home video   rented      one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own   everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise    with some films it might be just a secondary issue   but with `dark city  what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are   which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie    there s an old role playing computer game called `d   ja v     wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can t remember who he is   where he is and how he got there    the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict    the premise to this film is not unlike that game   only this time we don t have control over the protagonist    we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city   actually   it s more than just the city   it s the whole reality   that isn t just that neo gothic look   a la `batman     `blade runner         but is so fully developed it s almost a different genre completely    later he will learn that his name is john murdoch   sewell     but for now he has no idea what s going on other than the fact something is not right    the fact there s a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious   hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling    this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre   horrific tone    the man doesn t know who he is nor where he s going and it s interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him    in fact   this is the way all stories begin since it s impossible to know the history of a character   their feelings   values   morals   etc   until after we ve observed them for a while    but in this case   the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization   developing the mood and outlining the story    eventually   some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police    we met inspector frank bumstead   hurt     a quiet   unemotional   soft spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time    two other important characters are also introduced   dr   daniel p   schreber   sutherland     a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john s doctor   and emma murdoch   connelly     a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film noir movies    it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film    he also contacts emma   which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex   mysterious back story    but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city     which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo    everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance   considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot   its lighting   art direction and overall production design   they don t seem to be able to afford any gratuities    however   that might also be what s keeping it from reaching its maximum potential    by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place   so much unlike the real world we know   we come to realize that it s all a hoax    everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction    but   as the film s tagline says   `last night   one of us went off      for reasons that are never clearly explained   it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive   a process known as `tuning       the aliens   which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin   also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight    at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made   they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then    this premise certainly is interesting and director and co screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard    he does provide some explanations such as that dr   schreber is an assistant to `the strangers  because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form    the aliens mix and match the memories of the city s population to see who will change and who will not    in the process this creates for a good deal of deep   thought provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world    however   where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is    the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened   yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant   static and cold   mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don t help either      for example   john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her   yet in some scenes crucial to the film s plot   we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other   which is also part of the film s climax and ending    and that s what proyas seems to be inferring with the film   but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense    ironically   this is what made his first film `the crow  work so well   which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical   dark twisted world    with `dark city  the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message    still   the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable    there s a lot to like here   most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does    the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years    `dark city  is what the movies are all about   the escape from the real world    
Pos, linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction   and her being cast as dogma s lead is nothing short of inexplicable    she s still in fine form as bethany   an abortion clinic worker who s lost her faith    one night   a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany s bedroom    he is metatron   alan rickman     the voice of god   and he needs her help   she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church the fate of the universe depends on it    god would do it him/herself   but he/she is       missing   having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again    bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the   prophets   jay   jason mewes   and silent bob   kevin smith   doing double duty     the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith s films thus far    at some point   rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus   the undocumented   and very black     thirteenth apostle     and offers his assistance   as does divine stripper serendipity   salma hayek      it s a wild ride    they re in pursuit of loki and bartleby   damon and affleck   respectively this is probably the sharpest either has ever been     who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return    loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates    at one point   he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets    it s a nasty   guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks     how corrupt are you        wings of desire this ain t    since debuting with clerks   smith has grown as a director   particularly in terms of working with actors       chris rock is this film s only weak link between jokes   he s wooden      his no frills visual style hasn t changed much over the years   though   dogma s widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations     nor has his writing his characters still sit around delivering one caustic   hilarious speech after another    dogma chips away at big religious issues namely   the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs eloquently and articulately   but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition    as well   the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever    any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum   hurlyburly   anyone       and eventually dogma s pacing goes slack    a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game   in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings   comes at a point when we ve heard enough    because his change of heart   bartleby is initially the good cop to loki s bad   drives the climax   said rant is given a great deal of screen time    sure   affleck deserved a big moment   damon steals their scenes together prior     but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated    like tarantino   smith was a video age sponge who became a sample mad indie filmmaker    dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies   including indiana jones and the last crusade   with silent bob doing his best harrison ford   and weird science a shit demon attacks our heroes !  smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour   his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical   a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan   catholicism wow !     and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished    i bust   ed     a gut on several occasions    proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever    it s a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease   for to read it   one actually has to see dogma    the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ s   martin scorsese s 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis  controversial novel   in that it is not directly linked to the picture s content but to rumours and heresy    there s a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime   just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against       not one of them had watched it      every single person refused    smith and scorsese have a lot in common   and so do the two films in question   because both smith s bethany and scorsese s jesus are hollow shells without their faith    in fact   dogma s denouement   which follows a thrilling showdown that s worth the wait   is a catholic love in   a veritable recruitment poster       i felt sentimental about a religion i don t belong to    now that s powerful filmmaking     smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god   and that spirituality shines through    it s enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins    my religion is movies    when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine   in a roundabout way they re attacking what i live for   freedom of expression through celluloid    i therefore feel that   although i m no bible thumper   i m at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers    
Pos, you ve heard all the hype    you ve seen all their faces   natalie portman   the professional   as queen amidala   liam neeson   schindler s list   as qui gon jinn   ewan mcgregor   trainspotting   as obi wan kenobi   and jake lloyd   jingle all the way   as young anakin skywalker    if you ve read any reviews   you ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy    you also may have heard that this one s too kiddie friendly   and doesn t have enough content for adults    believe the hype    the effects are stunning   the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic   the lightsaber duels are amazing   and queen amidala s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth    but there s something missing here   and it isn t budget or effects   it s everything money * can t * buy    the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad stroked and flat characters    the most successful at this is liam neeson who   as qui gon jinn   a jedi master to young obi wan kenobi   has quiet dignity and a wise   commanding presence    he is the anchor to this movie   as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out    portman s queen amidala and mcgregor s obi wan kenobi don t fare nearly so well    amidala   the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation     !       comes off as stoic   stilted and caricatured   it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life      and obi wan   although mcgregor makes him very endearing   has so little screen time that he s nothing but a robin to qui gon jinn s batman    however   mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity   and he does a good job    he also absolutely nails alec guiness    obi wan in episode 4   6   scottish accent   and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise    in fact   lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit   and that s one of the problems with this film    i would never call myself a   star wars   fan   especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days   but i ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america    however   if you are the one person in america who * hasn t * seen the films at all or even recently   or who doesn t bother to brush up on the names of obscure characters   you may be hopelessly lost    for example   one of the film s main   nefarious   characters is senator palpatine    for those of you not recently steeped in   star wars   trivia   emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader s master in   return of the jedi   and   empire strikes back      so   obviously   his appearance in   phantom menace   is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series   thus making his role here more meaningful    a lot of the movie is like that    r2 d2 and c 3po make token appearances   and it s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience s pre existing fondness for them        because he doesn t do much to add to it in any way    same goes for jabba the hutt   who doesn t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy    even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film   tatooine   the desert world where luke grew up     coruscant   the cloud city from   empire strikes back       and alderaan   leia s home planet   which we never actually see   that gets blown up in   star wars     show up or are mentioned briefly in passing    what s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films    the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty    there s no meat   no substance   that makes you want to love the characters as they are   not as they will be    another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film    i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters   strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters   had mouths that barely moved   making them look more like muppets than actual characters    and jar jar binks   a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character   is intended as comic relief   but what he really becomes is annoying   and fast    unlike chewbacca and c 3po   who got their humanity   if you ll pardon the expression   from their interactions with the human characters   jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind   at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive   teenage mutant ninja turtles      furthermore   the dialogue is often stilted and corny   and sometimes downright infantile   thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot    oddly   this isn t just * my * judgment   lucas has said that he designed this film for kids    well   he s done a good job    the hero of this film   of course   is young anakin   but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight year old boy    that s not jake lloyd s fault   though   he does a good job of being a cute kid   which is apparently all lucas asked of him    that s another mistake   of course   because the cute tyke becomes darth vader    warning   spoilers ahead ! ! ! !  in my opinion   there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin s future evil in the film    the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks   and there s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie    he has a doting mother   pernilla august   making her first english  language film   and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine    but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn t all hearts and roses is yoda s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui gon jinn    his explanation       his future is clouded         warning   major spoiler ahead    enter at your own risk      of course   the noble qui gon dies at the hand of darth maul   a scary looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts   but has turned to the dark side    this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie   but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double sided lightsaber   and his scary facial makeup    because qui gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force   obi wan   qui gon s young padawan apprentice   one level below knightdom     must take over the training himself    so   at the end of the movie   we end where the saga actually begins   with obi wan kenobi and his young apprentice   anakin   darth vader   skywalker    did this story need to be told    i would say no    but is it a worthwhile movie to see    absolutely    if you don t enter the theater with jedi size expectations   and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle   then this is your movie    the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation    the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight    and yoda and young obi wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler   happier time    above all   this is a fun movie    not deep   not meaningful   and not profound    but fun    maybe next time   lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co write the script   and the guy who directed   empire   will direct    because if lucas does the next one himself   it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most   potential          
Pos, as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell   there is a wonderful   eye catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film    the shot has tibbs  face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars    to see these bars blocking his face   we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film    as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots   no matter how innocent tibbs is   he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin    the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is   instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous    this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds    it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film       in the heat of the night   was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america    jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental    in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers    he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present    preceding the very original   a soldier s story   and the recently released   the hurricane       in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters    the film   which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs   played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted    tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him    as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains   tibbs is the perfect protagonist    poitier also gives an excellent   noteworthy voice to his character    never nervous and always commanding   his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing    however   unlike   the hurricane   where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast   poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger   who won best actor for his excellent performance    as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him   steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role    he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople    he would refer to tibbs as   boy   and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him    as the film progresses though   there is a very gradual change in the sheriff    he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors    what i really enjoyed about steiger s character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film    he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil    instead   it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future    most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes    this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day    jewison s determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate       in the heat of the night   shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960 s    it displays this perfectly    however   the actual investigation   although it is not the main focus of the film   lacks interest    it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim    there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane   police officer sam being a suspect was not needed      also   it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does   but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered    the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic       a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson    he managed to be in the two best movies of 1967     in the heat of the night   and the even better   in cold blood        
Pos, in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance    ever since wall street   douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid 80 s    in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen   with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world    you d think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good natured veneer   but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton   douglas played the role straight and out in the open    in wonder boys his performance isn t showy or a tour de force   it s simple yet truthful    he embodies grady   a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes    grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map    when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop   we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms    grady points out   in his narration   that they only do so out of jealousy    their target is the very writerly named james leer   played by the always understated tobey maguire     a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for    leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions    he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges    he s portentous and gloomy   as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers   though his act is a little too calculated    he reminds me of the self imposed outcast film director   jim jarmusch   dead man   ghost dog      whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner   the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer     exclusively dressed in black   and with his spiked hair dyed snow white    leer is similar   a guy who equates quirks with depth    tobey maguire fits well in the role    with his round   sweet eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude    but unlike cort   maguire is easier to warm up to   he s a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility    katie holmes plays hannah   a beautiful   talented writing student just itching to get in grady s pants    this is a plot line i had trouble with    douglas   in his old age   is beginning to resemble jerry springer   a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions    at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady   maybe it s because i m jealous   and wish holmes was throwing herself at me   after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth     then i think of douglas s real life companion   the breathtaking catherine zeta jones    seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping    suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand   that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie   and i m pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas    there is a movie in there somewhere    grady   rather chivalrously if you ask me   resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell   a droll frances mcdormand     who is his age   but also married to another professor    okay   maybe not so chivalrous    there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says     she was a junkie for the printed word    lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice      robert downy j   r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm    downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual    he s arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance    the actor is perfectly cast here   and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor    i wish wonder boys had more of him    searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless   for it meanders through its running time   but that s part of its charm    and maybe i m a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia   a place i m greatly fond of   and a place rarely explored in american cinema    everyone has a sub genre   be it war films   westerns   dance movies   that they happen to be privy to    i m privy to films about literary types i   e    those individuals enthralled by the written word   and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch    the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters   rather than generic mapped out story points    sometimes the dialogue is too clever   but that s a problem i wish i found with films more often    another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted   like its characters   but as the story progresses it begins to open up    for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types   and as a low key comedy for its chuckle worthy throwaway gags    the gags are like those in the great robert altman   m * a * s * h   the long goodbye   movies   where jokes exist as asides on the fringes   like jokes in life often do    the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog   and incessant smoking of marijuana isn t ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things    curtis hanson   who before his last film   la confidential   toiled about with exploitation fare like losin  it   an early tom cruise sex comedy   and the hand the rocks the cradle   has graduated to more meaningful films    he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style   the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up    the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party   but in a wonder boys party   it fits    the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen    it s the cinematic equivalent to a good read   novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies    many will find it slight   but i found much to savor among its subtleties    
Pos, plot   derek zoolander is a male model    he is also very dumb and impressionable    for that reason   he is secretly hired and trained   so secret   that even he doesn t know about it   by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia   who wants to abolish child labor in his country    will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed    will zoolander ever grace the world his new   look      is this a funny movie    find out below        critique   there s a place in our world for   stupid comedies      films which don t pretend to take themselves seriously   are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes    there s also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history   might be an ideal circumstance during which to   relax   by watching something so completely frivolous    well   if you re in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment   ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time    of course   comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny   while others will grant them the   stupid     but consider it funny instead    i personally enjoyed it for the most part   cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry    snap !  it was also nice to see several real life models with small roles in the movie   not taking themselves too seriously    and if you re the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films   well   don t look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn   billy zane   winona ryder   christian slater   david duchovny   natalie portman and many   many others    i especially liked andy dick s complete make over as the masseuse    hi larious !  but with all films of this type   there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn t work    a few particulars which didn t strike my fancy included the bulimia and   orgy   sequence with christine taylor   the break dance fighting   and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this   why not just   make up   a country   instead of zeroing in on a certain people        i also could have done with less of the taylor character in general   since she wasn t all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then   more zoolander   dude !      but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me !  i almost pissed myself during the   gas station   disaster   absolutely adored the   walk off   contest   with david bowie as the judge   no less   and appreciated many of zoolander s moronic one liners     i was a merman       a  merman ! !        and i dare you to get his   monkey   photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie     you re a monkey   derek       a  monkey !      i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film   both of which zipped and zagged   and established a nice rhythm to it all    again   it s to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone   but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer   you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well    if you thought the trailer was dumb   skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something   a film from which there is an obvious influence here    blue steel   baby       yeah ! ! !  where s joblo coming from    austin powers   7/10     austin powers 2   7/10     deuce bigalow   7/10     dude   where s my car   7/10     freddy got fingered   5/10     jay & silent bob strike back   8/10     joe dirt   5/10     meet the parents   8/10     say it isn t so   3/10    
Pos, unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi   an artist whose palette is fabric    ostensibly   the film is a documentary   but use of that term requires stretching its meaning    many scenes appear staged   and a great deal of cutting and pasting has been done in the editing room    the cinema verite effect is a conceit    genuine spontaneity is at a premium   and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera   especially would be actresses like cindy crawford      director douglas keeve   who was mizrahi s lover at the time   freely admits that he   couldn t care less about the truth   but was more interested in capturing   the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion      despite violating nearly every rule of   legitimate   documentary film making   however   unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment    while it sheds only a little light on the behind the scenes world of the fashion industry   it presents a fascinating   if incomplete   picture of designer mizrahi    this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study    he s funny   energetic   and eminently quotable    he has unusual views on just about everything   from fashion     it s about women not wanting to look like cows     to mary tyler moore     between her and jackie kennedy   they shaped this country     to style     it s almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs        unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress    it s almost certainly different that anyone would imagine    the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look   including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies   then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection    in particular   unzipped traces mizrahi s development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show   which highlights a number of prominent models   including cindy crawford   naomi campbell   kate bush   and linda evangelista    on the technical side   a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped    a variety of film stocks were used   super 8   16 mm black and white   and 35 mm color    there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness    the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie   and   during the climactic fashion show   color is used to show the audience s perspective   while black and white is for the behind the  scenes sequences    nevertheless   some viewers will be put off by this treatment    while unzipped isn t an expose on the fashion industry per se   keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear    overall   however   this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else   and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed    when the designer declares that   everything is frustrating except designing clothes    that s beautiful and liberating     it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed

Pos, the event of events is upon us    people have waited twenty two years for the prequel to star wars and die hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it    i don t think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused    it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history    anyone who tells you   it s just a movie   is either lying or clueless    it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic    the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz   which is far too weak a word   that star wars epsode i   the phantom menace so effortlessly generated    but that does not mean that the film itself is bad    in fact   it is terrific    i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash    it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place    the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging   the trade federation   angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small   peaceful planet of naboo    the republic sent two jedi knights   people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as   the force       qui gon jinn   liam neeson   and obi wan kenobi   ewan mcgregor   to negotiate    unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur   the jedi and the queen of naboo   natalie portman   escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene    on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine   where they meet the movie s real focal point   young anakin skywalker   jake lloyd      he is an innocent slave boy   but   the force is strong with him   so qui  gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi    as any self respecting star wars fan should know   anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker    >from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor s movie    around 70% of the characters   if not more   are computer generated in one form or another   and though the effects are seamless   the movie lacks soul    i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade   cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this    this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far   with plenty of broad comic relief to go around   much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar jar binks    he s essentially a computer animated sidekick who says things like   exqueeze me      and   mesa go now   okeday       and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying    the visual effects are astounding   although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them   and the movie is a thrilling triumph    if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement    the climactic lightsaber battle   oh   come on   as if you didn t already know     among other things   is outrageously entertaining and defines the term   popcorn movie      what made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams    even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days   his work here is nothing short of brilliant    his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling    the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia    when you see   a long time ago   in a galaxy far   far away     when the familiar music plays   when the words   star wars   appear on screen   you ll feel a tingle even if you didn t see the movie when it first came out in  77    it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin   a boy whose innocence   we know   will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side    it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts   we know that it will do more harm than good   but they do not    we not only feel more involved in the story   but we feel like we re seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years    the phantom menace   although lacking in human aspects of the story   is a very worthy installment in the star wars    it works as an action flick   visually eye popping and often paralyzingly exciting   it also works as an elicitor of memories   a piece of exquisite nostalgia       1999 eugene novikov&#137    
Pos, sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest    some people call it   original   or   artsy   or   abstract      some people simply call it   trash      a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings    definitely a generation x aimed movie   a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke based musical dream sequence    whew !  anyone in their 30 s or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film    it s somewhat silly   it s somewhat outrageous   and it s definitely not your typical romance story   but for the right audience   it works    a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting    well sorry folks   but i haven t seen trainspotting so i can t really compare    whether that works in this film s favor or not is beyond me    but i do know this   ewan mcgregor   whom i had never had the pleasure of watching   definitely charmed me    he was great !  cameron diaz s character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp    the audience may find it difficult to care about her   thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him    misguided    you bet    loveable    you bet    a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city   utah    this was just one more thing i didn t know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke    maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise   but i think even if i had known   i would have been just as happy    a life less ordinary is quirky   eccentric   and downright charming !  not for everyone   but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies    
Pos, that thing you do !     r   tom hanks s screenwriting and directorial debut   that thing you do !   has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment   fun   lively   and oh so nice    it is the latter quality   however   that becomes a hindrance   for this  60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast    that thing focuses on the wonders   a teen rock band from erie   pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called   of course     that thing you do !    the group s members are   naturally a diverse group   there s brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy   johnathon schaech     girl crazy lenny   steve zahn     the lead guitarist   a goofy   geeky type known only as the bass player   ethan embry     and the film s center   guy   tom everett scott     the drummer who has aspirations in jazz    along for the wonders  ride to success is jimmy s perpetually neglected galpal   faye   liv tyler      hanks proves to be a capable writer director   deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964   which hanks calls   the last innocent year      the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music   which   like the other recent period music film   grace of my heart   was expressly written for the film   hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes  but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger   which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled   it s still playing in my mind as i write this      it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors   eliciting charming   likable work from the entire cast   most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler   who is remarkable in delivering the film s biggest and best dramatic moment    the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early  60s   they do not appear to be  90s grungers playacting   retro      yet for all the light   frothy charms of that thing you do !   it s nearly nice to a fault    while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days   there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting    everyone is so happy   basking in the glow of overnight success   marvelling at it all  except toward the end   but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness   ending on an appropriately feel good note    there isn t much of an edge throughout that thing  the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks s turn as the wonders  manager  and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it s bland    but a little niceness goes a long way these days   and there s no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do !   it s just about impossible to hate    it s an inoffensive   enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming   if not singing     that thing you do !     quite  possibly for days    to paraphrase a passage from the song   though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play   that thing you do !    
Pos,    he s back   and it s about time      was the motto for this television series pilot   i call it a pilot   i don t care what fox network says   revival of the cult classic british tv show   doctor who   that spawned no series   which means there are no smart network execs out there   not exactly news to a lot of people   i know      the motto was well chosen    the series was simple   it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies   including the evil daleks   and the master   who appears in this feature   played very badly by eric roberts    as good as this revival was   there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who    is it the acting    hell   no !  paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who ve played the doctor   including his predecessor and off screen friend sylvester mccoy   who appears once more for the regeneration scene      he looks right for the role   is a brilliant actor   and slips effortlessly into the role   the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would    daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr   grace holloway   the doctor s first companion that he kisses on screen   she is not your typical female companion who screams   and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor   she is a tough   spunky american   and ashbrook shows this well    young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee   and i ve seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end   this film included     which   imho   wastes his talent    the only problem with the acting is eric roberts    one time he had to say to mcgann s doctor     i always dress for the occasion      but he broke it up   and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric     i always        dress        for the occasion      you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act   and who s also british   like mcgann is as the doctor    executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role    i dunno who thought of casting him   but if they re reading this   news flash   eric roberts is * not * a star !  he rides on his sister s coattails   and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him    is this problem the kisses to the past    they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them   only whovians would   and they re good    is it the script or the movie as a whole    the script is a classy piece of work   featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue   and the movie as a whole is one fans will love   and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series    so what is it    simple   no plot    the master   on his last legs   sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him    the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey   but they accidentally land in san francisco   1999   december 31   where the master   with young street hood chang lee s help   opens the eye of harmony   which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor   with the help of female surgeon   dr   grace holloway   doesn t close it by then    virtually no plot    i was told the movie would ve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks   but a lot of rewriting went on on the set    that shows how smart people are   as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting   and that would ve gotten a four star rating out of me

works for an advertising agency    his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid life crisis he is suffering    estranged from both his wife and his daughter   lester starts to crack under the stress    his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies   and sullen apathy    carolyn burnham   annette bening     is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker    she carefully tends her rose garden   decorates her home with the best furnishings    but inside she is desperate    unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent   she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family    the third member of this anti family is jane burnham   thora birch     lester and carolyn s daughter    a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence   but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction    this funny   and frightening   slice of life is refreshingly simple    not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her    some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters    most notably is barbara fitts   allison janney     the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts    she has almost no dialogue   and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one    colonel fitts   chris cooper   is an angry and frightened man    his rage directed almost singularly at his son   ricky   wes bentley   who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham s    in fact they are the next door neighbors    anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in   american beauty      alan ball   who was the co executive producer of the hit tv series   cybil   and creator of the new sitcom   oh grow up     has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years    not one character in this film rings falsely    and the depth of personality in each   is achingly honest and insightful    the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as   the graduate   or   lolita      kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances    his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age    finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become   lester tries to return to his youth    he quits his job   actually blackmailing his employer for one year s salary     starts smoking pot   fantasizes about his daughter s girlfriend angela   mena suvari   in a marvelous performance here     starts working out   and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet    mr   spacey s performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous   that we can be certain that come oscar   time   we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees    annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career    carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy    unable to cope with her growing disillusionment   she forces herself to maintain her demeanor   driving her further and further into desperation   adultery and possibly murder    ms   bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone    the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words    thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her    jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family   and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment    her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning    she is the prototypical trophy child    when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team     i m so proud of you   honey    you didn t screw up once !       the bitterness and resentment are palpable    thora birch is a young actress to watch    praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance    colonel finn is a man in complete denial    his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend    wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma    the boy next door who may be more foe than friend    a deceitful and calculating young man   whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him    mr   bentley s performance is the one troublesome note in the film    that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar   that one almost faults the performance for it    director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle    scenes of carolyn walking through the rain   carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character    the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful   capturing the season in all of it s harsh beauty   fall has never looked so inviting   yet depressing      every nuance of   american beauty   begs it s audience to think and examine    it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come    and well it should   as it is simply one of this years best    
Pos, will hunting   matt damon   is a natural genius    for a movie character   that s usually a death sentence    it s a trait associated with what my brother calls   too good for this world   movies   like phenomenon or powder    forgive me for spoiling the ending   but will doesn t die    this is no formula movie    in fact   it s quite fresh and original    it s a character study more than anything   and that s not surprising   considering it was written by two actors   damon and co star ben affleck    will works whatever kind of job he can get    first he s a janitor   then he works construction    off screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him    on screen he hangs out with his friends   picking fights in robust   romanticized hemingway fashion    lambeau   stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves     a math professor   learns that the janitor   will   is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics    having confirmed he s not a fluke or a savant   he does what he can to get will into the education system    he is firmly rejected    finally   will lands in jail for one of his fights    lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him    will   barely   decides to go for the therapy over prison    lambeau treats will like a son    he s proud of   and amazed by   will s accomplishments in mathematics    he encourages will and tries to give him structure   knowing that   with a little discipline   he could be bigger than einstein    will isn t really interested in academia    he knows he would be the best in his field   and therefore spend all of his time in an office   explaining math to people like lambeau    he would rather work construction   which breaks lambeau s heart    meanwhile   will attends his mandated therapy sessions    it s not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau s   a   list    will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade   and how to keep them from affecting him    shrink after shrink refuses to return after will s mockery    lambeau s last hope is his old college roommate   now a psychology teacher at a small time community college    knowing that will is going to try to shred him too   sean   robin williams   agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein    true to form   will finds sean s emotional weakness and attacks    but unlike the other shrinks   sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions    like a foster mother with a fussy child   sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride    like the foster mother   sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach    robin williams is excellent in this role    he s not an actor with a great range   but in the right roles he has great depth    in this movie   as in awakenings   there comes a point when the quiet   shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance   and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes    williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling    i have compared will to a foster child and that s not entirely fair    emotionally   he has a lot to learn   but he is not a child    he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants    sean   his girlfriend   his pals   and lambeau all help him grow   but he didn t start out asking for   or particularly needing   help    his exceptional gift singled him out   and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction    if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama    it s too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama   but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama    it is emotionally engaging   but it s not quite larger than life    this isn t a problem per se   but at times i didn t know quite how to take it    but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie    a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow    it doesn t just happen   it takes a good script   good acting   and good direction    good will hunting has all three    if you are at all inclined to see it   by all means   go    
Pos, if there s one thing in common about all of hollywood s major studios   it s that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more    although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures   fox searchlight and fine line respectively     it s obvious there s no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater    so when a movie like gary ross  pleasantville comes along   wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production   it s a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes    although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted   pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no thought movie    quite the opposite is true   in fact   as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen    the story   both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation   captures the essence of statement making in the cinema    not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution   and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross  work   it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough    kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture    it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who   through quite a bit of luck   find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named   pleasantville      maguire   as the reserved bud parker   is perfect for the pseudo world   but the rebellious mary sue   witherspoon   is not at all made for the father knows best times    it s not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end   and begins to teach the townspeople   in a quite unlikely way   what life is * really * like    soon hues of color creep into the black and white world   and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism   others fear the strangeness    at one end is a soda shop owner turned painter named mr   johnson   jeff daniels   and at the other end is a close minded mayor   j   t    walsh   and his chamber of commerce   but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town    fine performances are turned in all around    maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads   but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j   t    walsh   in his latest and final posthumous performance      daniels brings an atmosphere of awe   inspiration   and hope to his character   whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness   almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman s envy    for daniels   it s his most commendable performance of the last three years   or more   and for walsh   it s a complementary exclamation point on a fine career    also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen   and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish    there s not much to dislike about pleasantville   and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don t    
Pos, what do you get when you slap together a movie based on a story by the legendary george lucas   directed by virtuoso director steven spielberg   and starring one of the biggest box office stars in the world   harrison ford    you get one hot fudge rockin  good time   that s what you get ! ! !  plot   professor/archeologist indiana jones sets out to find the long lost mystical ark of the covenant before the nazis get their grubby fingers hands on it    adventures   snakes   romance and mucho action ensues    critique   astounding movie packed with non stop action   stunts galore   an interesting story line   great one liners   a solid cast   a catchy musical score   and all the fun and adventure that you could squeeze into a two hour thrill ride    if you don t enjoy this film   then you just don t like action movies   period !  if you re young   you ll enjoy its humor   its cool action sequences and its gross out factor at times    if you re a little older   you ll appreciate the interesting plot line   the romance   and yes   the mountains of adventure    watching this movie made me feel like a kid again   dreaming and fantasizing about fighting the bad guys   travelling to different countries   making the impossible   possible !  harrison ford is perfect as the every man with the brains of a scientist and the brawn of an outdoors adventurer   and spielberg manages to achieve the ideal balance of action   fun   adventure and humor    now if you really want to have a good time   check into this movie on the same night as its two sequels   rent a jug of iced coke   truckloads of nachos and salsa   an adventure hat and whip   and prepare to gag yourself into a world of action movie heaven !  little known facts about this film and its stars   this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations   including best picture    it lost that award to chariots of fire   but did manage to win for best art direction   best special effects   best film editing and best sound    actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones   but was committed to his hit tv show     magnum p   i        in filming the well of souls sequence   the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on    hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas    however   once all the snakes were on set   it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them   so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths   and these were used as well    looking closely   you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not    an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra    during his escape from the museum where it was housed   he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong    also in the same script   indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine cart chase sequence    both of these scenes were cut from the script   but ended up in 1984 s indiana jones and the temple of doom    this film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo    the same type of opening is present in its sequels    jock s airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number   ob cpo      this is a reference to obi wan and c 3po from george lucas  star wars   9   5/10      also   the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2 d2 and c 3po    they can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark    the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip    as legend has it   actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time   and asked if the scene could be shortened    spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy    the entire crew laughed and that s how it was filmed    when indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra   you can see the snake s reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford   also some fingerprints and stuff like that    when indy is dragging along the ground   hanging onto the nazi soldier s truck with the ark inside   you can see the pad that he s being dragged on    
Pos, `we run tings    tings don t run we       sound advice from capone   paul campbell   to his squaddie   or partner     floyd   winston bell      jamaican film   shot entirely on video   featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo styled brotherhood morals   and a little gunplay      capone   a tough as nails super cop   gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home   while he was with his lady   and killed his partner in front of him    when he arrives   he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse   thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie   jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw     so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook      capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and   much to his disappointment   also finds out his childhood friend ratty   mark danvers   has been helping him    torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend   capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again    directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne   assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct     one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while    shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films   although the action isn t as hyperkinetic as most of woo s films are    the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though   and eventually begin to take on a life of their own   beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after      the make up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well   with flawless squib work on display from the effects team    the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue   spoken with thick jamaican accents   half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang     just adds to the interest    paul campbell   as the `loose cannon  capone   essays his role perfectly   displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times    mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty   the part time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together    unfortunately   carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective   largely because his underlings seem to run all over him     but then again   that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed    the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs   and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists   sly and robbie   who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones   maxi priest   bob dylan   james brown   grace jones   herbie hancock   bootsy collins   and carly simon among others      the end credit song   `we run tings    by the group red dragon   is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review    oddly enough   desmond ballentine   who plays the character deportee   is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta  reggae as the performer ninjaman   and he doesn t contribute a single song to the film   that i could see     which is virtually unheard of here in the us    at the time of this writing   third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us   coming off of a six month box office breaking run in jamaica   where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time   bringing in $21 million in jamaica   which is roughly $500   000 us      palm pictures   the company that released the offbeat   but entertaining six string samurai   is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market   i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters    chris blackwell   founder of palm pictures   was also involved in the production of another jamaican box office smash in 1981 entitled countryman   so i d say he has a pretty good track record    overall   third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo   ringo lam   tsui hark   and many other action films by directors from hong kong    if action films are your thing and you don t mind intermittent subtitles   then you can t go wrong with this film    the performances and the story are solid   if only a little cliched   and the action is tight    i m not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like   but apparently third world cop s honors are well deserved    
Pos, at first glance   it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8 year olds    that s true of home alone 2 and i d bet money that it s true of home alone 3   opening soon      but home alone actually has a lot going for it   and the cartoon slapstick doesn t get in the way    the mcalisters   all 15 of them   are going to france for the holidays    four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse    the littlest kid   kevin   is the victim of the older kids  cruelty    kevin s patience runs out when he learns that his plain cheese pizza has already been eaten   and he s going to have to starve    he attacks his big bully brother buzz   who had been teasing him    the fight disrupts the already chaotic dinner   spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table   a few cousins   and an uncle    the knee jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin    nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased   but they all point their fingers when he fights back    the ultimate punishment comes from mom   catherine o hara   who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night    on his way up the stairs   he tells her that   families suck   and that he hopes never to see any of his family again    that night the power goes out   knocking out the alarm clocks   so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport    in a surprisingly plausible setup   kevin is mistakenly accounted for   and the family heads off without him    it s interesting that   in a subtle way   his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children    first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling   and second   they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class    they re two thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child    meanwhile   kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true    he s finally rid of his family !  life is a dream come true    he can jump on the beds   watch r rated movies   eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips   and dig through his big brother s secret box    slowly   the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane    he grooms himself   he does the laundry   he goes shopping     i bought some milk   eggs   and fabric softener        he also starts to miss his family   not just for their company   but for the security they bring    the furnace in the basement is a scary monster   the old man next door is a snow shovel murderer   and two crooks are trying to break into his house    macaulay culkin is cute but he isn t much of an actor    still   we can see that kevin s character grows   thanks to some good direction and editing    for example   acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night   just as   santa   is getting in his car    kevin asks the man to pass on his request   he wants his family back   to the real santa    he learned how to deal with the furnace    you turn on the lights and it s not so scary anymore    he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow shovel murderer   who actually turns out to be a nice man    they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid    finally   in the last 20 minutes   kevin confronts his last fear   the bandits   head on   literally      this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick   and after the movie s genuine dramatic setup   it is dessert    it s a lot of fun   and it doesn t overwhelm the rest of the movie    on the whole   home alone is a great holiday movie    john williams  original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls   and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings    but it does have its flaws    the smallest problem is that culkin doesn t act very well    as i said before   he is cute   but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin s insight into his character    the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda   the villains threaten kevin s life about five times    instead of   i m gonna get that kid   they say   i m gonna kill that kid      some might argue that the tone is the same   but i strongly disagree    mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux pas    i ll probably never see home alone 3   and i wish i had skipped home alone 2   but i do enjoy home alone almost every year    don t let your impressions of the others detract from the original   which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick    
Pos,    comedy   rated pg   runs about 1   40    starring   john goodman   kathy moriarty   and a bunch of teenagers    directed by joe dante and written by charles hass     summary   lawrence woolsley   john goodman   brings his new horror film mant !  to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis    he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town    we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them    quick and easy review   i really enjoyed matinee    the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely    unlike many comedies this film tries   and succeeds   in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh    the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story    the performances of all the principals are right on the mark   particularly john goodman as the schlock master    so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted   yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours    longer   more detailed review   [beware of spoilers]  the primary reason i enjoyed this film was   that while being a comedy   the film also had an intelligent story to tell    too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh    you watch the movie   laugh a lot   leave the theatre and take nothing with you    matinee is not like that    i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis    i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film    but most importantly   i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters    the comedy of the film centers around goodman   his character   and the film he brings to key west    i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today    he is highly expressive both physically and vocally    i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink    the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature   however   while the star   goodman is actually not at the center of the film    the movie is really the story of the four teenagers   discovering who they are and what they want   against a background where at any minute it could all end    i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic    they tried to block it out   they tried to escape from the concerns of their world    unfortunately it kept creeping back in   particularly with the fear   and the chaos of the time    while the comedy centered on goodman   and the drama on the teens   there was a great deal of overlap    several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light    one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store    if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy   but it works here    another reason i like this film is that i like b  science fiction movies    one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space       note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies   but one of my favorite to see      while mant !  never got made   many films like it were   and mant !  serves mostly as dante s homage to the b films he loves    so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good   humorous story    this isn t a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent   well thought out   film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way    enjoy !  
Pos, when  star wars  came out some twenty years ago   the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image    when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars   we see constellations   meteor showers   and cool space ships    when han solo goes light speed   the stars change to bright lines   going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point    cool     october sky  offers a much simpler image  that of a single white dot   traveling horizontally across the night sky    was it really only forty years ago   when sputnik was launched   and that before then   no satellites ever existed    have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then technological achievement   even though it was from the russians    it sounds hokey   but when that scene occurs near the beginning of  october sky    i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam   played by jake gyllenhaal    determined to make a dent in the space race   he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them    it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket    when lovely teacher miss riley   played by laura dern     suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair   we know exactly who is going to win    but the joy in a film like this is in the little details    for example   homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class    if he has any strengths whatsoever   it is an undeterring vision   and a good organizer    it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school   who knows more about rocket science than he does    it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property   that is   the entire coal mining town     he must walk eight miles one way   just to set up the rockets   which will fail   fail   fail   and fail again    homer+s dad is played by chris cooper   a favorite actor of mine since  lone star     here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in  matewan    instead of organizing union rallies   he is the head of the coal miners   who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions    this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year   note how multi dimensional his character is    he is his son+s last nemesis   as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams    but he truly loves his son   and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how    through coal mining    because of his character   we can see how far we+ve come    the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us    we don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family    the paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet   and he knew of no other life    so  october sky    far from being merely a feel good inspirational film   offers much food for thought    and this is the best type of inspirational film   the one that you take something with you    btw   the final image of the film is just as simple   is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal moving white dot against the night sky background    another commonplace image   to be sure   but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago    
Pos, warning   contains what the matrix is    rated r for sci fi violence    starring   keanu reeves   laurence fishburne   joe panteliano  some may be disappointed with the matrix    i ll tell you i was    i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen    now wait wait   i know most of you loved it   and i m not saying i didn t like it    what i m saying is the first half was extremely slow    now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show    don t be fooled   this movie has a big story    and big chunks of talky moments    but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par   deserving the rating above    ok now to the story    well this may take a while    ok first of all   our world we live in now   is not the real world   actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix    a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out   when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world    he does so   and finds out that he can do anything   be anything he wants to be    but he has to fight a  matrix skipping  bad guy   who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him    laurence fishburne   his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves    but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were    yeah there were some in the first half but not enough    the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie    now for the second half   it is explosive   and saves the movie    some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking    the sound   the music   and all the effects were effective   and the last hour kept us entertained    but with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes   this movie is at least 40 minutes too long    one would have wished for a better  matrix    but i do have to say   i did like it and i was entertained

Pos, every year   hollywood crowns a new   it boy     a young actor pegged for major movie stardom    inheriting the mantle from last year s   winner     matthew mcconaughey   is matt damon   and   like mcconaughey   he proves to be more than just a fresh young face   as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release  john grisham s the rainmaker and good will hunting    damon has his first major starring role   a la mcconaughey   in a john grisham adaptation  in this case   francis ford coppola s take on the rainmaker    damon plays wet behind the ears attorney rudy baylor   who   immediately after passing the bar exam   finds himself representing the mother   mary kay place   of a terminally ill young man   john whitworth   in a big league suit against a negligent insurance company    while rudy s   and the film s   main concern is this case   he also finds time to protect a young wife   claire danes   from her abusive husband   melrose placer andrew shue   in a mercifully brief role      written for the screen and directed by coppola   the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously    coppola s most notable  and effective  contribution to the tried and true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself   which largely comes in the presence of danny devito   as rudy s unlicensed co counsel   and golden globe nominee jon voight   as the insurance company s hotshot attorney      the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous   but danes is as superb as always    then   of course   there is damon   who nicely juggles the weighty   the insurance case   the spousal abuse   and the humorous   rudy s often comical naivete   requirements of his role without missing a beat    as good as he is in the rainmaker   damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting   directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself    damon plays the title character   will hunting   a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius    in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction   an mit math professor   stellan skarsgard   taps his old college friend   community college psychologist sean mcguire   robin williams     to counsel the abrasive   standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life    good will hunting is the touchy feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests   but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon s intelligent script touches    even though no one   and   if so    very  few people   can directly relate to will s burden of superhuman intelligence   the insecurities he suffers are universal    the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors    williams delivers a nice dramatic turn   affleck   a hot up and coming actor himself   chasing amy     turns up in a warm and charming performance as will s best friend   and the ever appealing minnie driver shines as will s harvard schooled love interest    the clear standout in the cast   though   is damon   who bravely does not soften will s prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard  not  to care for him    so many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine   but based on his impressive work in john grisham s the rainmaker and especially good will hunting   it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come    
Pos, synopsis   leonard shelby   pearce   is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife    leonard has only a few clues to the murderer s identity   to make matters worse   he suffers from a condition which inhibits the creation of short term memories   meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier    because of this   leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself       memento   traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination    review     memento   is the sort of movie i wish i d written   i can think of no higher praise than that    i am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant   involved   original movie as this    an instant film noir classic     memento   is virtually flawless    the script is unlike any i have ever seen    a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity    although the idea of starting at the   conclusion   of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the   start   is not entirely new   never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence       memento   is endlessly exciting and inventive   a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself   and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre    and it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality   there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively    nolan s direction is equally effective   never losing its crispness and clarity despite   memento    s challenging gimmick    and to top everything off   all the performances rise to the occasion    pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard   moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie   and pantoliano s teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality       memento   may be the year s best screenplay   and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001    
Pos, earth is a harsh   unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent    people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict   as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets   indian and pakistani   muslim   hindu   sikh   parsee    the story takes place in lahore   which was indian before partition   and pakistani afterward   regardless of what its citizens might call themselves    the action is seen through the eyes of lenny   maaia sethna     a young parsee girl   but it is really about her nanny   shanta    shanta has a small circle of male admirers    two of the men are suitors   hasan   rahul khanna     a hindu   and dil navaz   aamir khan     a muslim    the others  sikh   hindu   muslim  are older   some are married   but all appreciate shanta   who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das       she also starred in deepa mehta s previous film   fire   the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water      in an early scene   the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny   political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears    one of the men remarks   jokingly   that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along    he is wrong   the men make barbed little comments to each other   spoken like jokes   but with an undercurrent of fanaticism    the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses    it is easy to perceive   in these squabbles   the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter    the group around shanta represents   in a sense   a united india   and shanta herself the ideal motherland  one which all love   which inspires hindu   muslim   and sikh to live peacably together    but the circle around shanta is sundered   as is the state    a sikh is persecuted   hides   then flees    another man is murdered    the group of friends will not meet again    the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction   a plate shattered on the floor   a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child   and   most brutally   when the tension escalates into violence   a man is held down   tied between two cars   and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles    it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully    the crux of earth s plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz    his sisters are killed in brutal fashion   by hindus   because they are muslim    dil navaz seeks solace from shanta   and asks in desperation that she marry him    but she loves hasan   and tenderly refuses dil navaz s offer    the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him   and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality   the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate    despite the things he later does   it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him   but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things    the conclusion  the consequence of dil navaz s transformation  is rather abrupt    the story earth tells does not end    it just stops    it is an appropriate finish   giving us closure would have imparted   at least on an aesthetic level   a sense of resolution   of satisfaction    but there was no resolution for india and pakistan  they have been at war   on a small or large scale   for decades    since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation   it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus    there is no healing to be had   no closure   on any level   despite the needless   tacked on ending   with voice over narration from lenny as an adult   framing the story      earth is   in some ways   an unexceptional movie    it does not reinvent the wheel   following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas    but deepa mehta s directon is assured   and the issues she addresses run deep    earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou s to live and tian zhuangzhuang s the blue kite did for china   they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history    such films strike me as inherently valuable   even when flawed    they may be biased or inaccurate   but they bear the weight of human hardship   and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other   more inventive films   often lack    it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries   the events shown may have happened decades ago   but they still touch a nerve    the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year    in the near future   india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other    at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen   after seeing earth   i have a much   much better understanding    
Pos, up until about a year ago   john travolta s career consisted of those   look who s talking   movies   notice how they never called them look who s talented   and the 1991 bomb shout   which was bad enough to make most people scream      but somewhere along the line   travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again    weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again   while barry   robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight to the cutout bin album aptly named   size isn t everything     and of course   they learned that sales are everything      but now travolta s back on the hollywood scene once again   and i think we all know why    four words   contract with the devil    and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich s   contract with america      no   satan is much more humane    anyway   yes   travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld    how do i know    i own the document in question    amazing what you can buy at those collector s shops for a few hundred dollars   isn t it    get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction   with travolta as crime minion chili palmer    he goes to collect some of the mafia s money from a b grade director   gene hackman   and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game    sure   a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood   but i guess that s beside the point    palmer is determined to get hackman s next project made   so he sets out to convince big star martin weir   danny devito   to star in the movie   bringing along down and out horror actress karen flores   rene russo     who has already had affairs with hackman and devito    it doesn t take a las vegas odds maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well   after the customary sexual tension and denial   which has been used in every comedy from   who s the boss      to speechless    it works in this case   unlike   who s the boss      although it s interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also    complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman s other films and want in on this one too   along with travolta s mob boss trying to track him down for defecting    get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction   despite the obvious similarities    this movie doesn t have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i ve seen this year   yes   even better than halloween vi      get shorty is my kind of movie   one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence    i m definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on    are you getting this   shorty

Pos, the computer animated comedy   shrek   is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups    for children   it offers imaginative visuals   appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces   loads of action and a barrage of big laughs   including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances   apparently a requisite in contemporary family films      for adults   it s a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids    all in all     shrek   is a snappy ride   although there are a couple of points i found disturbing    but first the basics    based very loosely on a 1990 children s story     shrek   follows several momentous days in the life of the title character   a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using    shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp   until a local nobleman disturbs his peace    petty tyrant lord farquaad   take away the   awk   in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one liners   owns the land on which shrek resides    he proceeds to turn the ogre s yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle    as a result   shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice   pinocchio   the big bad wolf   the seven dwarfs   and the three bears   to name but a few    an enraged shrek storms to the castle   only to find farquaad   john lithgow   ready to bargain    lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from   snow white   has shown him the way    all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife    the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of   the dating game     when snow white is shown   the cheeky announcer purrs     even though she lives with seven men   she s not easy !      farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona   cameron diaz   and offers shrek a deal   if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon protected   lava moat filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne   the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds    shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest   accompanied by a motor mouthed donkey   eddie murphy   determined to make the green grump his best friend    they finally hook up with the princess   only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet    for the matter   the dragon offers a few surprises as well    the movie references a great many other flicks   from   babe       that ll do   donkey    that ll do     to   the graduate      but the lion s share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney    the public domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits   pinocchio is referred to as a   possessed toy   and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin   he bellows     get that dead broad off the table !       but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad s royal domicile   which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom   from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like   it s a small world      which brings me to disturbing point number one    i laughed at all the disney swipes   but found the mentality behind them a bit sad    the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known    for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other s film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day    and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer    here s a suggestion for the two boys   grow up !  put the past behind you !  there s room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can t play nice   then go to your rooms !  the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad    beyond all the irreverence     shrek   actually has a message   people should learn to look beyond physical appearances   because true beauty lies within    it s a lovely notion   but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad s diminutive stature    do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable    the pompous   selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers    adding short jokes is simply mean    still     shrek   is a rollicking good time    the computer animation is mostly impressive   although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky     the voice work is strong   particularly from eddie murphy     the laughs come fast and furious   and the moral   tainted though it may be   is a good one    to trot out a clich       shrek   is fun for all ages    parents   though   should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short   tall   skinny   fat   etc   is a bad thing    
Pos, after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film   you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again    there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles   as a master would teach an eager apprentice       you caress the noodles with the chopsticks     he says     then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying    see you soon        of course   it s meant to be a parody   but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety    you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat   not something you like   not something you enjoy   but rather something you experience    experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses   fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts    trust me   you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point    juzo itami s tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western   set in modern day japan    a stranger   goro   tsutomu yamazaki     comes into town and finds tampopo   nobuko miyamoto     the proprietor of a small   hole in the wall noodle shop   trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman   pisken   rikiya yasuoka      goro   to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles   gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen   emerging bloodied   but victorious    goro finds that tampopo s ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away   just to eat a bowl of her ramen    the problem is   her fare is something less than popular   and less than appetizing    however   goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest   and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert   enlist the aid of a wealthy patron   and make friends with the former enemy    this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems    take   for example   when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner    the price is too high   but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum    tampopo meets him at his store late at night   and he leads her to a back room    she protests   thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives   but he insists    just when she is about to bolt for the exit   he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door    she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day   her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience    this scene   while comical   is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation   then of relief and discovery    there s also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who   despite their economic trappings   are all gourmets and master sommeliers    we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet    the scene is meant to bring a laugh   but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor   food is something which everyone has in common   and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all    there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film   which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people s lives    a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor    surrounded by her children   she is obviously in her last hours of life    her husband comes home   and seeing her worsened condition   demands that she get up and make dinner    the viewer knows the husband s intention is not to be mean   he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived   and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this    in a near miracle   the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal   then brings it to her awaiting family    as the family eats   she looks on them and smiles    preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her   and for a brief moment   she too enjoys the normalcy    then she falls over   dead    for a moment   the family is stunned   but then the father yells at the children     keep eating !  this is the last meal your mother ever made !    crying as they do so   the family finishes the meal    the scene is comical   awkward   moving   and beautiful    by including the vignettes   itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film   but surprisingly   they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline    instead   they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo s goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble    because the film parodies a western   the construction of the plot is fairly predictable   but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the   good guys   come together for the final showdown    in this case   the showdown is against the ramen    if they eat tampopo s ramen   soup and all   tampopo knows she has succeeded    it s pretty obvious what the outcome will be   but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life   you can afford to cut it a little slack    
Pos, there s an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last    george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy    return of the jedi   the final installment of the series   is easily the most innovative   action packed   and entertaining of the three films    the dark   eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone    instead   for return of the jedi   we have good triumphing decisively over evil   a resolution to a love triangle   and walking teddy bears    even darth vader doesn t seem very intimidating this time around    with the arrival of the emperor   an apparition like creature played by ian mcdiarmid     vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman    return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back    luke skywalker   mark hamill     princess leia   carrie fisher     lando calrissian     billy dee williams     chewbacca   peter mayhew     c3p0   anthony daniels   and r2 d2   kenny baker   are on a rescue mission to luke s home planet of tatooine    their goal   to save han solo   harrison ford   from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt    it is at jabba s home   a creepy looking stone fortress guarded by hog nosed beasts   that most of the added special effects come into play    from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba s sand barge   the effects are top notch    as soon as han is freed from his cryo freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt   it s back to outer space   where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire s newest threat   a second   more powerful death star   that   if activated   could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor    so   while the fleet prepares for the final battle   luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks    there   they are befriended by the ewoks   the teddy bear like native race   and luke   fearing that his presence is endangering the group   turns himself over to vader    return of the jedi has some interesting elements    the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well acted    from a technical point of view   the space battles are amazing   easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films    not only are there many   many more ships   but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved    on one level   return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects    in the special edition   even more ships are added   making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch    the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films    by now   or then   1983     mark hamill   harrison ford   and carrie fisher have all matured in their on screen personas    the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific    as in empire   billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for    newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy   cunning   and evil creature   although he s not as imposing as vader was in star wars    although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen   return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment    with the spectacular   new special effects   the adorable ewoks   the sinister jabba the hutt   the evil emperor   the same old millenium falcon   darth vader s incredible betrayal   the destruction of the new death star   and the always lovable yoda   return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang    congratulations to george lucas   whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come        
Pos, why do so many children s films treat their target audience with utter contempt    too many of those who write or direct for children s movies assume that the kids just can t handle serious   thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues       the iron giant     which was directed and co written by brad bird   late of such animated series as   the simpsons   and   king of the hill     assumes that not only can children handle such discussions   but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time       the iron giant   holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience   making it a film that s enjoyable for both children and adults alike    hogarth hughes   voice of eli marienthal   is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard working single mother   annie   jennifer aniston     in a small town in maine    after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away   hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception    he comes across a giant robot   vin diesel   from space that eats metal for food    after saving the robot   nicknamed the iron giant   from electric shock   hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts    because of damage he suffered upon landing   the giant has forgotten what his original mission was   so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy    realizing he can t just keep the giant in a barn all the time   and that the giant needs food   he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean   harry connick jr       an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time    it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can t keep the giant a secret forever   because a government spook named kent mansley   christopher mcdonald   has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security    he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant   and takes up residence in hogarth s house as a lodger    meanwhile   the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind       the iron giant   is exactly what family films ought to be   because it doesn  t talk down to its audience    the story is simple   very simple   about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy    it s very similar to the spielberg classic   e   t       and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of   the iron giant      the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg s film   such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy    the film delivers several serious messages   the most important of which is one s ability to choose one s own fate    hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be   a hero    the final sequence is touching and appropriate   though i won t give it away   i will say that very few will be disappointed    the animation   while not up to disney standards   what could be   after   tarzan         is good enough to make you forget you re watching a cartoon    the giant is computer animated   while the human characters are all hand drawn the old fashioned way    the characters  faces are done quite well   drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible   but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief    fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth   and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother    harry connick jr   does a nice characterization as dean   and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney   of tv s   frasier     as an army general called in by agent mansley    unlike several cartoon features   each character is actually a developed personality   rather than a stereotype   and is actually integral to the plot   rather than being a superfluous comic relief sidekick   a clich   disney still hasn t ditched      dean   for example   could have been a stereotypical beatnik   his character profile seems to suggest that     but he is presented as a character with real emotions   thoughts   and motivations    even the heavy   agent mansley   is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to   but out of his own fear and paranoia    a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper thin stereotypes and figure the kids won t mind   but   the iron giant   has clearly put a little work into making the characters real   and it pays off    the film isn t only around to deliver heavy handed messages   though    it s also very funny   and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy    the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things   such as dive into a pool   are handled well   and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing   having worked on   the simpsons   for many years    a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to   outlast   one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed   and also extremely clever    the film even takes some jabs at america s nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war   satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to   duck and cover   in the event of a nuclear attack       the iron giant   has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films   and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing    instead of seeing people get bonked on the head   we get well timed   clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with    when you get right down to it     the iron giant   is no more than the story of a boy and his robot    the story is so straightforward   so quaint   that it ultimately becomes charming    though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person   when it comes to family entertainment   simple is the way to go    it s akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word   but it s not the story that sets the film above others of its kind   but rather the elements that go into the story   namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue   which   the iron giant   has in spades

Pos, roman emperor marcus aurelius   richard harris   chooses his trusted general maximus   russell crowe   as his successor    however the emperor s evil son commodus   joaquin phoenix   murders his father before the announcement can be made   and maximus   as well as his family   is sentenced to be executed    maximus is able to escape his executioners   but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo   oliver reed      proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money   he being a former gladiator himself     and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator    when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum   proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle    maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus    gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania   and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required   40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence   style of moviemaking    the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used        it s choppy slow motion which is unsettling and distracting    it s similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan   but nowhere near as effective    the actual gladiator battles are thrilling   but also a bit disjointed    many times it s unclear as to exactly what s going on        all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled    we re not sure who s blood or by who s hand though    there s an instance of this earlier in the film too that s disappointing    it s comes when maximus escapes his executioners    some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free        but i still don t know exactly how he did it    russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995 s virtuosity    for whatever reason his stardom never arrived        but he should have it now    from here on moviegoers should now be able to say     let s go see the new russell crowe movie      he gets the best scene in the film   and one of the best moments of all recent movies   when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum    it s both rousing and chilling    joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character   which could have easily happened      commodus is conniving   sneaky and whiny   but phoenix never lets the character get silly    it s a very good   and very creepy   performance    oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator   and it s a huge loss to the acting world    i ve always been fascinated with reed        he s one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years    it s ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again   as he gives a fun and sincere performance    the film is dedicated to him   and he will surely be missed    reed s death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem   as he still had scenes to be completed    rather than recast the role   and end up reshooting a great deal of footage     a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars    ironically   that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film    anyway   this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of   for about twenty seconds   and if you aren t looking for it you won t even be able to tell    some of the other digital effects are less convincing however        and like i always say   noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately    it s sad that such a good film has these distractions    movies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects    keep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events   but is entirely a work of fiction    however it s a work of fiction that s great entertainment   and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a   d

Pos, ingredients   starving artist lusting after a beautiful woman from his childhood  synopsis   great expectations   1998   is a modernized version of a charles dickens novel    in the original charles dickens classic an orphan boy named pip learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict   his relationship with a bitter old lady named miss havisham   and his hopeless lifetime infatuation with havisham s snobbish adopted daughter   estella    the gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends pip to london for pip to become an upper class   gentleman      pip leaves for london with   great expectations   to be groomed into a gentleman so that he can one day be classy enough to marry estella    but life has a way of complicating things    pip becomes an arrogant s   o   b    until he learns just who his secret benefactor is    in this new 1998 version of great expectations a poor florida lad named finn   ethan hawke   with a talent for drawing has an early memory of helping an escaped convict   robert de niro      but soon the focus of finn s life becomes romance   as he develops a lifelong infatuation with estella   gwyneth paltrow     an upper crust girl with some psychological and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment    estella was raised in wealth by ms   dinsmoor   anne bancroft     an eccentric   aged and embittered   man hating single aunt whose groom left her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage    this causes estella to  fear the daylight  of relationships   but finn thinks it s just a case of snobbery    when finn becomes a young man   an anonymous benefactor sets finn up in new york with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous artist    finn leaves florida with   great expectations   to be a successful artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the snobbish estella    what will happen to all of finn s   great expectations      opinion   if you re looking for a romance with a happy ending   look no further   you ve found one here    ethan hawke is romantic lead       he romanced winona ryder in reality bites    he romanced julie delpy in before sunrise    he romanced uma thurman in gattaca    now in great expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow   a rail thin blonde      hawke plays a lovestruck   earnest and unchanged finn throughout the film    meanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease and ice princess   estella s whole purpose is to get men to fall in love and then hurt them rather than become intimate    anne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic ms   dinsmoor   while robert de niro carries off the convict part suitably    the difference between the classic dickens novel and this 1998 adaptation is that the dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless themes about class struggle and love   whereas great expectations   1998   is more artsy   less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with a lifetime tease

Pos, hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death   no pun intended   honest      it s a shame   too   because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b movie monsters    i mean   come on    are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour    hell no    and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell   but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well   not commonly associated with horror films    and not only has the idea been done too many times   but with the possible exception of from dusk  till dawn   has not been done very well lately   either    this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu    i got to go back to the times when making movies   even horror movies   was considered an art form   and not just done to make cash like nowadays    and that is exactly what this film is   art    i ve been a horror fan since i was eight years old   and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers    let me backtrack a minute    when i say   intellectual ground     i don t mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that   i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to   a little bit of thinking is involved    with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what not   you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown    those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit   movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen    you see   this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore    this is a thinking man s slasher flick    the   nosferatu   of the title is orlock   max shreck     a strange   hermit like count that   as the film opens   is looking for a new home to buy    he employs the help of hutter   gustav von wangenhein     a real estate salesman   or something to that effect   who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen   greta schroeder      upon orders from his boss   hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock s castle and speak to him about his new home   which just happens to be right next door to hutter s      the next morning   he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck       not  really a good sign    he then discovers through some reading that the count is a   nosferatu     or vampire   one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans    but by the time he pieces this together   he is too late   orlock has already embarked to hutter s hometown via boat    will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock    the character of orlock is   of course   dracula    the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker s novel    just thought that was an interesting little side note        probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment s digitally restored cut   now available in stores    however   this version is quite different than maunau s original masterpiece    the movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o negative and color tinting   much like the 1984 version of lang s metropolis    now   i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here   bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one    but alas   i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen    but that s just my bag   you may like the newer   more   modern   version better    either way   i suggest investing your money in a copy    if you like what they have done with it   pop it in the vcr and enjoy    if you re like me   just do what i ll do during future viewings   turn the color all the way down on your television   hit mute   turn on some bach or mozart or whatever   dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made    
Pos, stendhal s syndrome   a condition where   in the presence of art   a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression   suicidal behaviour and personality disorder    grim stuff   to be sure   but the subject of a remarkable film from italy s master of the horror thriller dario argento    boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone   the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento    it follows his disappointing american debut trauma   1992     the patchy opera   1987   and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980 s    based on the novel by graziella magherini   the film stars argento s daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist killer    visiting florence to follow up several leads   she is lured by the killer alfredo   thomas kretschmann   to an art gallery   a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail    at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints    posing as a bystander   alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer   a strange game of cat and mouse begins    a gripping story evolves   and a coherent one   too   which may surprise those familiar with argento s often lumpy narratives    the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop hunting killer scenario    it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character s psychological disintegration    the script explores its psycho sexual themes with intelligence and candour   perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers    but as dark as its themes are   the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years    argento is once again working in his native italy   and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences    effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here   and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent    the film s opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination   flashback and real time with tremendous style    proof that   at his most inspired   argento remains one of the world s most exhilarating filmmakers    the cast is generally good   though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless    asia argento s performance is by turns risky   awkward and fascinating    it s a difficult role   and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts    thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo   and marco leonardi   of cinema paradiso   and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy   does okay as anna s work colleague and increasingly confused love interest    but perhaps the stendhal syndrome s single most striking element is ennio morricone s soundtrack    active since the 1960 s   morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts    it s mostly a variation on the one theme   a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary   haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards    it s been three decades since argento and morricone worked together    this is a long welcome reunion    if the film has a fault   it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn t quite reach a completely satisfying climax    but by the closing scenes   the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento s career     * note   see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can    dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web

Pos, zero effect gets its title from the main character   daryl zero   bill pullman     although we don t understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film    zero is a private investigator   perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived   at least he d like to think so      however   he s a socially inept being   and eccentric in every possible way    this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are    zero s accomplice is steve arlo   ben stiller     a   normal   guy who does the business side of the job    he s the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero s greatness as an investigator    the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero s talents to soon to be client gregory stark   ryan o neal      it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box   and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about    zero takes the case   and the plot thickens    his path leads to a young   pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan   kim dickens      despite her luminous and seemingly harmless presence   she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark    through his investigations   zero learns why   but not without developing feelings for gloria    feelings that   because of his reclusive behavior   are new and confusing to him    i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film    i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators   and   every once in a while   a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away   actually   no private eye film has ever reached chinatown s greatness      zero effect   which is jake kasdan s first effort as writer/director   is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts   it s an original   funny   and completely involving motion picture    with so many cliches available to this genre   i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them    but he didn t just successfully avoid flaws   he has created a great film here   one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment    take   for starters   the great cast of characters    pullman is terrific as zero   showing a comic flair that i really haven t seen from him since spaceballs    zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here   the fact that he s an almost exaggeratedly twisted   emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe    pullman s performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance   and the occasional voice over as he s going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious    ben stiller is also a very funny individual   he s the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny       i ll shoot you     he says to stark at one point       i have a gun   and everything      his character is also well drawn   with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend   angela featherstone   who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job    o neal also gives his character a bit of depth   and kim dickens   last seen   and underused   in mercury rising   gets a chance to show us her talent here   giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs    i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film    kasdan s humor is of the best kind    soft spoken   and mostly dialogue driven   though there are some great visual jokes      it s the kind of humor that s funny even after you ve seen it five or six times    there s one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is   an how that makes him such a great detective    what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed   or standing motionlessly   with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face   his eyes pointing to something off camera   but obviously to nothing in particular    i can t convey to you how funny this is   but what makes it great film making is that it has a point    scenes like this are frequent   and they provide solid characterization of zero    as a side note   i don t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy   not to sound elitist      i find things funny that many do not   and vice versa    there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film   and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it    i have a feeling the humor here won t appeal to everyone   but there s certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone s interest    jake kasdan   son of writer/director lawrence kasdan   is only 22 years old    i found this out after seeing the film   and i can t remember ever being so impressed with a film maker    his direction is stylish without being pretentious   and his writing is mature   full   and developed    zero effect is the kind of film that i ll buy for my collection    smart   original films like this are rare as it is   but this one actually has a heart and a soul    at the end of the film   i was involved in the characters   and i was satisfied with the outcome    and   with kasdan s undeniable talent at such a young age   all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future    
Pos, the long kiss goodnight   r   meryl streep tried it and failed    even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well bared assets    however   geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight   a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband   renny harlin    davis plays samantha caine   a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years    with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey   samuel l   jackson     she slowly remembers  and reclaims  her past as charly baltimore   tough as nails cia operative    needless to say   with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no goodniks out to erase more than her memory    shane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script   i m not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag   but for what it s worth   it delivers the goods    like black s previous work   such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout   the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny   quirky dialogue    the humor especially works well in this case   for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously    but there s no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell   who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car        while ice skating    jackson and davis make a good team    jackson is funny as ever as ever   in fact   his spirited line deliveries   especially when he first appears   are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction    as good as he is   the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis   who shows much promise as an action heroine    what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn t take herself too seriously    she is obviously in on the joke   slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation    this is not to say that she doesn t need work  sometimes she lays on the   toughness   a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature    but should the public embrace the film and   in turn   the notion of a kick ass female   davis could have found her special niche    it seems as if davis and harlin s first collaboration   the middling pirate epic cutthroat island   was just a dress rehearsal   albeit a very costly one   for long kiss   in which the wife husband team hit their action stride    anyone simply looking for a fun   escapist entertainment that requires little to no thinking will find this film to be a more than welcome kiss    
Pos, screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker    screenplay by andrew kevin walker    inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving    directed by tim burton    starring johnny depp   christina ricci   and casper van dien    special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken    synopsis   investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation    townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them    cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery    comments   tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years    batman   of course   is perhaps his best known film and led to a string of less successful sequels    he s done biographical work   on the director ed wood     children s movies   nightmare before christmas     and a homage to alien invasion movies   mars attacks !      sleepy hollow   his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while   shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies    sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s   especially hammer studios  reworkings of dracula and frankenstein   and american international s series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe    christopher lee   in fact   star of many hammer productions over the years   appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders    the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s    one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein    i mention these allusions for a reason    seasoned horror film fans   including myself   will smile at their inclusion in this film    with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies   especially the blair witch project   the most overblown turkey of the decade     we needed a film like this    not only does it have a sense of history   but burton s skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror    the film s eerie landscapes and foggy towns   indeed   overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie    johnny depp   a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands   plays ichabod crane   who has apparently changed occupations from irving s original story and is now an investigator    depp is adequate in his role    no more   no less    equally adequate is christina ricci   who plays the love interest in the film    she s a good witch too    how cute    one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters    the two actors   however   carry the movie well enough   but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine    veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough   who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks   are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers    while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points   i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing    you have to pay attention    andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay    he s the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven    walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood   and sleepy hollow certainly doesn t hurt his growing reputation    as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker   sleepy hollow is quite graphic    there s a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings    this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to    a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25   30 minutes covering the youngest s eyes with her hand    he was obviously upset by the movie s intense violence    if you re looking for a good scare   however   sleepy hollow is definately recommended    
Pos, mpaa   not rated   though i feel it would likely be pg   for martial arts violence      with three movies already   re   released theatrically in america   and at least three more on their way   jackie chan is one of the newest   hot properties   in action adventure stardom   and it s just about time    for over twenty five years   jackie s been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong   thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy       drunken master   has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to   make it big     this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong    i m not entirely sure why   exactly    in many ways     drunken master   is similar to most of jackie s other early films   such as   fearless hyena   i and ii     master with cracked fingers       half a loaf of kung fu       spiritual kung fu     and others    in fact   looking at all these early films together   one gets the impression that they were stamped out   cookie cutter style   at a rate of four to six per year   all using the same casts and telling very similar stories    to be honest   i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste    they re quite different from action movies as we know them in america    these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past   with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together       drunken master     though its plot is tighter than some   is no exception       as an aside     drunken master   was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw   and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen       in  a movie theater in seattle   as part of an asian film festival    at the time   i didn t really think it was anything special       but  after having seen more films like it   it s kind of grown on me         drunken master    s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies   such as   fearless hyena   i and ii and   master with cracked fingers     slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh seeming master   and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end   a formula that has been   adapted     to put it kindly   by american films such as karate kid      more specifically   jackie chan plays the part of wong fei hong   aka   naughty panther     a fun loving   practical joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good   but not  quite  good enough    after embarrassing his instructor s assistant by beating him roundly   then beating up a bully in a marketplace   wong fei hong tries to hit on a pretty girl   but discovers that she   and her mother   can hit back   better than he can       and  is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt   respectively    his father   wong kei ying   is unhappy about this   and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages    kei ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment   which fei hong does not like at all    while escaping from this punishment   fei hong meets up with a drunken old man   who proceeds to thrash him soundly   then take him on as a student and thrash him some more    this turns out to be su hua chi   a legendary master of drunken style kung fu    he assigns fei hong a series of bizarre tasks   such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame   cracking walnuts with his hands   and other such exercises   that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up    then   when he s ready   he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu    unfortunately   the lazy fei hong only practices six of them           drunken master   features some wonderful martial arts sequences   with jackie winning some fights and losing others    it s been said before   but i ll say it again  these fights don t just  happen    they re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance   and it shows    in his fights   jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment   benches   jugs   cups   bowls   fruits and vegetables  often in new and surprising ways    the fight scenes   particularly those toward the end of the film   are unparallelled in most american films    whether jackie wins or loses   it s really something to see       and  it s often as funny as anything   too    and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very   very good at    there s very little that s new in this movie  jackie winning fights   jackie getting beaten badly by a master   jackie going through punishment or training       these  schticks have all been seen before   in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties    but they re still hilarious as ever    likewise   jackie has a  great  supporting cast   many of whom were also in other early jackie films   and they re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own    the really big thing about   drunken master     though   that inspired several copycats   including a couple starring jackie himself   and a sequel fifteen years later   was the drunken style kung fu    i m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu   but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security       and  it apparently helps if you re drunk while you re doing it    genuine or not   i have to admit   there s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what s going on    come to think of it   perhaps this element is what accounts for this film s success over any of the other jackie films       it s  not just martial arts   it s the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go     whoa          on the negative side   the cinematography in this film is nothing special   the film stock is rather primitive   the plot is often rather slow   and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background       gone with the wind     this isn t    still   if you like martial arts films   or like what you ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more   give it a shot    it s much more   real   than chuck norris or jean claude van damme    you might very well like it    another interesting thing about   drunken master   has to do with its video availability in the us       drunken master   is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original   letterboxed   hong kong subtitled form   commercially available on vhs   from magnum video   in a gold box   for about $10      there are plenty of other early jackie films around   but these are typically either in dubbed   pan and scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase    thankfully     drunken master     at least   is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen   at a very affordable price    if you like   drunken master     take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there   even the dubbed ones aren t really  too  bad       if  nothing else   you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue      i particularly recommend   spiritual kung fu       half a loaf of kung fu     the   fearless hyena   movies   and   snake & crane arts of shaolin      also   the mostly unrelated storywise sequel     drunken master ii     will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year   though what its american release title will be is still uncertain   and comes  highly  recommended by this reviewer    also   for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei hong   who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore     i ve been told to suggest the   once upon a time in china   series starring jet li   though i haven t personally seen any of them yet      if you choose to watch   drunken master     i really hope you enjoy it   and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that s out there    all in all   i give this film an    
Pos, well   i know that stallone is 50 years old now   but in daylight he doesn t look it !  daylight is a great disaster movie    if you ve seen cliffhanger   you ll know stallone s character already    a guy with a bad past   but is in the right place at the wrong time    a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying * very * flammable toxic waste    a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball   and what a fire ball it was !    stallone   a former emergency medical service man   is chauffeuring a rich couple around   when they reach the outside of the tunnel   before the explosion    then   30 minutes into the movie   boom !  >from here on   the plot takes a back seat   and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged    most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat    there are a few melodramatic parts here   but   they tend to work out well    there is no general antagonist in this film   but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that    daylight is a great film   i saw a non matinee showing of it   and i thought it was worth every penny    the characterizations are mostly flat   one dimesional   but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters    rob cohen   dragonheart   does a great job with this film    
Pos, logical time travel movies are a near impossibility    considering that the skeptic s best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities   writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task    occasionally   we get a film that does manage it    terry gilliam s   12 monkeys   was one such film    but more frequently   we get films that don t much deal with it at all    there is one question to ask in this case   does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies    the   terminator   films made up for them with exciting action     back to the future   did it with an entertaining story   and the new film   frequency   pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own    is   frequency   filled with plot holes    yes    does it matter    not really    the film opens in october of 1969    firefighter frank sullivan   dennis quaid   puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job   then goes home to his loving wife julia   elizabeth mitchell   and son johnny   daniel henson      the double pronged story flashes forward to 1999   where johnny   now jim caviezel   is all grown up and working as a police detective    a strange occurrence    the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city    allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in  69 and that john has found in the present day    though both are initially skeptical of the idea   john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire   and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom    now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive   john is initially overjoyed   until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous   a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women    frank and john now must work together to set things right   with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past    the premise of   frequency   is unusual   and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept   john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions    this isn t explained   you just have to go with it    when frank doesn t die in a fire   john is the only one who remembers it differently   while everyone else remembers it the new way    the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities    1969 and 1999    are to each other    sometimes frank s changing the past results in something happening right away in john s world   and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time    now   the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this   and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted   but nevertheless logical   if i thought about it hard enough   for example   the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer s murders was because the change had already happened in frank s world   and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change     but explanations aren t really the point    when   frequency   gets cooking   it s a riveting little thriller   even if it is confusing    what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment   and   frequency   works as long as it keeps moving    the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion    director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure   frequency   as good hollywood entertainment   establishing decent   likable characters   making us care for them   and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved    i liked many of the creative touches   the split screens   allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities   and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward    it actually uses the 1969 mets orioles world series   the one that featured the amazin  mets   to great effect    frank uses john s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him       admittedly   this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself      i even liked the final scene   which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods    some may find this scene blindingly confusing   as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious   but it does make sense if you think about it   and give the script a lot of leeway     and let s face it   it s a darn cool way to end the film    there are enough surprises and plot twists in   frequency   to keep you on your toes   and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant    the other major thing to appreciate about   frequency   is the handling of the father son relationship    quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily   it s a rock solid job from both actors    the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept   how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative   or with a future descendant    watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question    the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film   if we don t believe in the characters   we don t care about the outcome of the thriller plot    here   we do care   because we like the lead actors    i also liked some of the supporting cast members    elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles   playing julia the doting wife * and * mother   but still performs admirably    andre braugher   late of the television show   homicide   life on the street     gives a nice supporting turn as frank s best friend and future colleague of john    he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank s world series predictions come true before his very eyes    braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here   simultaneously dismayed and amused    perhaps the only thing i didn t like about   frequency   is the overly sentimental coda   during which the camera s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard    but that s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics    i freely acknowledge that   frequency   may best work as a   guy   movie   since it focuses on the very male oriented idea of father son relationships   echoes of   field of dreams   can be easily heard     but the underlying concept is universally applicable    who wouldn t want to speak with a long dead parent    or see how their children turn out       tell me about your life   son      excuse me while i mist up    and don t call me a sissy    
Pos, blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood s premier leading men    blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it    it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well    although   at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie    the ideas behind blade are good   as is the basic plot of the story    but at times   things seem to get a bit muddled   and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once    that really doesn t take away from the story too much   but it does hurt it a little bit    blade   snipes   is half man   half vampire    his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire    including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust    blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother    but this isn t as easy as it seems   because the vampires in blade s world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films    the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires   but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires    where do vampires get money    well   in blade   they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations    i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea   and a great addition to the movie    blade runs up against the evil deacon frost   stephen dorff   a maverick in the vampire community    he isn t content to live among humans   and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority    he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all powerful vampire    rendering him virtually unstoppable    it s up to blade to see that this doesn t transpire    admittedly   blade is style over substance through and through    the story is a relatively forgettable one   but it is fun none the less    the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type    this isn t a film that is going to win accolades for its performances   and the actors know this    the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise    it s a popcorn movie   and no one involved has any illusions otherwise    blade s production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster    the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done    although   the mtv style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences    blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre    this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle    what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life    very cool    
Pos, the truman show   paramount pictures   running time   1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait   jim carrey s dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen    in case you ve been asleep for the last few months   the plot centres on truman burbank   carrey   who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven    his life seems so perfect   however   because it s controlled by christoff   harris   creator of the truman show   the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of    that s right   burbank s life is being broadcast live to the american public   and seahaven and all it s inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage    the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far        with an idea so different   it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator    luckily   the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages   yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie    talking of carrey   he s perfect in this movie   enjoying the best role in his career    his character is a re inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask   1994   and is completely suited to carrey s persona    he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode   shrieking and being silly   but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey    he s not completely dramatic like the film promises   however    ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff   the megalomaniac creator of the show    quiet and well spoken   he burns an image into the viewer    unfortunately   he s barely in the film   and for the first hour dosen t appear at all !  also disappointing is natascha mcelhone s character sylvia    she plays the role well   but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her    the supporting cast is excellent   and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect   so perfect it s creepy    the philip glass soundtrack is also superb   and is used to great effect during the film    peter weir keeps the film going   clearly having fun    the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card    although it is slightly slow to begin with   about half an hour into film the pace really picks up   and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll    sadly   though   the film is practically over when the film is in full steam    also   concerning the ending   it is slightly too ambiguous   which was disappointing    the screenwriter   andrew niccol   who bought us gattaca   1997   delivers an entertaining script   and manages to keep the plot in trim    while christoff s plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly   they never go over the line   which would have been easy for niccol to do    also   there s some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show    overall   the truman show is excellent entertainment    certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces   it should be viewed by everyone    it offers something to every member of the audience   and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed    overall rating=  review by david wilcock   1998     you know   for kids     norville barnes  
Pos, no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan s harrowing   humorous   horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe s novel about young lad francie brady s   eamonn owens   descent into madness in 1960s ireland    on one hand   it was difficult for me to become invested in francie s story because he is such an unsavory character   unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs   nugent   fiona shaw      on another hand   i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie s darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick   needy child   having been raised by a drunken father   stephen rea   and a suicidal mother   aisling o sullivan      on yet another hand   i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his   for lack of a better word     bad   deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them    however   the butcher boy s power is undeniable   and the film as a whole is unforgettable  perhaps because it is so disturbing    what makes it so unsettling is the francie s overall wink wink yet matter of fact attitude about everything   expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie   rea again      think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs   and you ll sort of understand    anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens   love francie or hate him   you cannot take your eyes off of owens    the butcher boy truly is a twisted   unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable    in the lobby after the screening   i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was   i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust     that movie was so unfunny !       i didn t know what to expect    it s like something you chase for so long   but then you don t know how to react when you get it    i still don t know how to react        michael jordan   on winning his first nba championship in 1991       or    my thoughts after meeting him on november 21   1997  
Pos, just how inseparable is the team of sgt    martin riggs   mel gibson   and sgt    roger murtaugh   danny glover      let s just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road   flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction   his partner actually does it !  the familiar lethal weapon family is back   including rene russo   who is now the expectant mother of riggs  child and joe pesci as the soprana like   foul mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye    new to the team is chris rock   also a fast talking   up and coming detective    trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go   and in this film   that is no exception    even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride   they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship    we here some ominous music   which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen    gunfire ensues   and when it s all over   the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord    although they don t know what they re looking for   their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action    and there s plenty of action here for two movies    led by fighting sensation jet li   whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive   he does what he can to make sure that no one finds out what they are up to    li is ruthless in his approach   will kill anyone just to make a point   and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives    there are terrific car chases   explosions and gunshot galore    it s a summer action recipe followed to the letter   and the result is nothing less than pure   unadulterated summer fun    but even too many explosions can get boring    to counter that   we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li    luckily   he d rather fight hand to hand instead of firing off guns    meanwhile   when the detectives aren t reloading their guns or running from fireballs   they re engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets    everybody gets in on the shtick    russo screams during her delivery   the crime lord has a few funny bits when he s being interrogated while being given laughing gas   and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones    gibson and glover are always in sync and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano    score one for the old guard    
Pos, since 1990   the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style    now   instead of emphasizing feel good stories replete with characters of noble virtues   the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow    this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times   as 1993 s schindler s list shows    most of today s mainstream drama   however   creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience    that s why pictures like october sky   which are a throwback to the good ol  dramas of yesteryear   are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema    the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam   jake gyllenhaal     a teenager in the 1950 s company town of coalwood   west virginia    it s a well known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships   the rest grow up to work in the coal mine    the mine   which is run by homer s father   chris cooper     is not the place for homer   however    after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957   homer feels a connection with the outside world    as he puts it     anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did      drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast   homer begins to construct rockets    with the help of their history teacher   miss riley   laura dern     and several mine workers   the four are soon bound for great things    october sky is a skillfully crafted film   and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston    johnston    whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars    certainly knows what he s doing here    he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust    he does not push any barriers   but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film s charm    his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost    such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers   or the silent struggle between homer s mother and father    the cast is well chosen   although the true bright spots are the supporting roles    laura dern   jurassic park   lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher   giving the boys the support and guidance they need    her role is instantly likeable    chris cooper   the horse whisperer     as homer s father   is less likeable    even downright despicable at times    but his turn here gives gravity to the movie    he s definitely a driving force in homer s life   and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable    the script is generally cheerful   projecting the boys  endeavors in a lighthearted manner    there are moments when it becomes predictable    such as the train tracks scene    and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist    it highlights the essence of youth   however   and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps    october sky should be a success with audiences    although it doesn t have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she s all that   it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards    it s a welcome change to the dramatic genre   and one that everyone should see    
Pos, a big surprise to me    the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off   but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues   john belushi   is such a dumb idea i really had no hope    they replaced him just fine    not with john goodman   he didn t do much of anything   but with the brilliant actor joe morton   who can really sing    the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant   who s ten    this was another of my fears for the film   but he s a really good dancer   and plays a mean harmonica   although he may have been dubbed      things that intellectually had bothered me before   like no mission from god   everyone being richer   it not being filmed in chicago    gave me no problems at all    i m quite pleased that there were less car pile ups   because they meant less music   and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing    there s a few early crashes   and then one huge pile up   but after that it all stops    it s just the music    one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway s song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him   but there s no problems with this    the music is all as good as ever   tons of great musicians showing up    with the exception of johnny lang   who can t sing   all the musicians do a great job    the only real problems i had was the special effects    these were superfluous and a waste of money    since the film isn t doing very well   they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel   which i want to see    the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide       http   //www   geocities   com/hollywood/academy/8034/  remove no spam to reply       drive carefully but recklessly     mama   child s toy   the only excercise i take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise      peter o toole  
Pos, after having heard so many critics describe   return to me   as an old fashioned hollywood romance   i kept asking myself going into this movie   what exactly is an old fashioned hollywood romance    what made   return to me   old fashioned and old hollywood    was it the tunes from sinatra   etc     legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on    was it the glamorous   sophisticated feel    the charisma of the two leads    even now i can t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer   because i haven t see that many old fashioned hollywood romances    i don t think any of the romances i ve seen have been classified as such    which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics      return to me   was old fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic   the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider    it was traditional   magical    we knew it couldn t be too daring   or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in    it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity   tenderness   and love   from director bonnie hunt   that it couldn t help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings    the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt s direction    from the very first bird s eye view of chicago   zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland   david duchovny     accompanied by the   return to me   ballad   by whom       we can tell we re in for something sweet    the scenes between the characters are endearing   truthful   with just a hint of fantasy    real people don t act that way   real people aren t that nice    we know all this   and yet we want to believe in these folks  existence    the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale   but hunt s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal    everything is ordinary  yet beautiful  in this film    >from the festive little family restaurant to grace   minnie driver   and bob s wardrobes    from the eloquent   not in a hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints    from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen    the most beautiful part       return to me   has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family   the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist    we care for them   laugh with them   cry with them   we re concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father    whatever hunt did   she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors    disappointingly   david alan grier s charlie   however much i like him   was the most flatly written    duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona    with the help of his fellow co stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder    instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of   the x files      duchovny   who is excellent at understatement and self deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen    minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet   innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer    though an unlikely pair   duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses    while   return to me   functions remarkably as a laugh out loud comedy   a romantic scenic tour through chicago   and a tearjerker   the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop    the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife s heart    we already know that there s going to be a happy ending   we feel like we spend the entire film   however enjoyably   in a straight line going towards that point    as a result bob and grace click almost too quickly  yes   i know she s supposed to have his ex wife s heart and everything  it seems too effortless    the main subject is a love story   and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters   whose story might not have that much meat after all      however   in the spirit of   return to me     it won t do to be too picky about how   old   hollywood tells its stories    i loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt    it shows    the bottom line     return to me   is nothing remarkable   and yet its sweetness   sincerity   and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn t imagined    
Pos, wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon   denise richards   and neve campbell that deals with all the issues   sex   love   murder   and betrayal    the setting of the film is a town named blue bay    it consists of many swamps and slums and   on the other hand   rich estates owned by the town s different benefactors    the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town s ritzy   expensive high school    it is here that we meet all of the core characters    there s guidance counselor sam lombardo   police officers ray duquette and gloria perez   dark mysterious senior suzie toller   and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan    we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor   but none more than kelly    throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape    shortly after   suzie   too   confesses that sam raped her as well    this pushes kelly s sex craving mother   sandra   to stop at nothing until sam is convicted    during the trial   kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her    however   it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls   it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor    after sam is cleared   kelly s mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her    it is then revealed that sam   kelly   and suzie were all in on it together    it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda    matt dillon stars as sam lombardo    sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into   and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage    he isn t the obvious best of actors   but dillon does give a convincing performance    however   his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film   making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles   although he never had many to start out with in the first place    neve campbell   who most people relate to scream and scream 2   plays blue bay outcast suzie toller    suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film    campbell is very successful with this character   adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch    playing kelly van ryan is denise richards    kelly is your typical   rich   sexy   head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses   like her sexpot mother sandra    one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother    denise richards   still hot off the press from starship troopers   gives the most interesting performance in the entire film    in the beginning   kelly looks to be a paper thin character   but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy   but dominating as well    kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette    this character looks to be one of the most boring   predictable in the film    however   it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story    still   the film doesn t seem to gain much from bacon s performance   only his name    in the supporting cast   theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan   daphne rubin vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez   and bill murray shines as sam s lawyer   ken bowden    hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film    although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller   the eroticism   which is portrayed with good taste   is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters    this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it s share of twists    
Pos,  * * * * * * minor plot spoilers in review * * * * * * * * * * * * no major spoilers are in review * * * * * *  the previous two   alien   films have each had their own unique styles to them    the ridley scott s alien was very much a stylistic suspense film    james cameron s aliens was much more of an action film    and i liked each film separately for which it was    now alien 3 is out    and it is it s own film in the same right that alien and aliens were    unlike aliens   alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens    this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off    the survivors of the expedition to lv 426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens    the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item   an egg    in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch   find its quarry   which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured   an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel    this vessel crash lands on fury 109    everyone in the vessel is killed   except ripley    the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash    fury 109 is an ex mining/maximum security prison    when closed down   some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet    all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years    ripley s arrival sparks a problem with the inmates    as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner s sport   there is an infestation of lice on the planet    being an ex prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons    so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own    i will not go into detail   but you can guess what happens here    the alien is loose and no one believes ripley s outstanding story    she finds comfort in the arms of the colony s doctor    yes   after 57 years ripley has sex    it is not gratuitous   in fact   we don t even see them kiss   but it is just as well    a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film    there is a lot more gore in alien 3    in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two    it also sports a new alien with 4 legs !  i won t say how   but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle   which i am sure will be explored in alien 4    sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character    her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination    the rest of the cast is also quite good    notably   charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109    alien 3 has a very distinct look    this is due largely to its director   david fincher    mr   fincher   who until now has only directed music videos and commercials   has done an incredible job here    his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no   alien   film has before    for mr   fincher   i see a long prosperous career ahead of him    the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry    elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the   alien   series been set in    this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii   james horner s aliens      this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring    this is a great score    the ending to alien 3 is quite good    there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up   but it played very nicely    i will not ruin the ending for you    go see the film    i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season    alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien    and when they make alien 4   perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in    
Pos, are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store    wafflemovies   com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves    everyweek   wafflemovies   com  reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video    here is a sample review    welcome to sarajevo  in light of america s recent intervention in kosovo   welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years    set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events   this picture examines the human and societal

carry the mortally wounded mother into a church    joe is cocky   but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn t even know    his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson   stephen dillane      michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world s lack of interest    henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother s death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread    he decides to take action when a united nations  delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth    henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines    he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult    during his visits   he befriends a pre teen girl   emira   emira nuseric   who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner    he promises to get emira out of harm s way if he gets the chance    after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children   henderson loses hope    however   his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina   marisa tomei   and her children s aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans    unfortunately   only babies are wanted for adoption   so henderson pledges to take emira to england    the group of children   nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy    can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps    the movie was beautifully and sensitively made    director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred    they show the destroyed lives   families that have been split up   and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with    this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson   his producer and flynn have befriended    the group of twenty somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life s simplest pleasures and amenities    one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth    like the rest of those deeply effected by the war   this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live    winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room    the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics    winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities    this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies   com  selection mad city    we watch them struggle to cover the horror   while trying to remain professionally detached    however   they are human and question the reason behind it all   why no one cares   and how they can get out    stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson    he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events    dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy    henderson realizes that he cannot save the world   but he can help a few    it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary sandra bullock disaster two if by sea    woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest   most versatile actors of his generation    harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character s caring nature and vulnerability shine through    harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men   cheers   white men can t jump   as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one    this ability will serve him well and give him a long   successful career    america s involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place    for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict   the entire movie   most importantly the opening scenes   provide a history lesson    war is a foreign concept to most of us in america    battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to    televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war    this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world   something we don t do enough of in 90 s america    
Pos, many people dislike french films for their lack of closure    while possibly shallow   i ve often had a desire for a sense of epiphany   or at least a resolution   in the films which i view    there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional   however   the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion denying protagonist   stephane   daniel auteuil      stephane   daniel auteuil   is a master violin maker    he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing    even the relationship between he and his boss   maxime   andre dussollier   is a controlled   and almost manipulated association   highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches    in the beginning of the movie   stephane is a closed   solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man    camille kessler   emmanuelle beart   is a master violinist and the new love of maximes    maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife    like stephane   camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved   sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges    when stephane and camille meet   there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals    however   whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane   stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him    stephane ignores his feelings for camille   which the audience cannot help but to see is present    as the movie progresses   the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another    these two people   with very similar approaches to life initially   react to their new circumstance very differently    stephane becomes even more rational and controlled   while camille becomes more tempestuous   until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship    however   their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation    the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well   due to his relationship with a master violin teacher    however   apparently   he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing    consequently   stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays    in contrast   camille had almost given the violin   years earlier    however   with the aid of her manager   she has progressed to being almost one of the world s finest   successfully submerging herself to her playing    during the course of the movie   we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions    stephane attempts to remain unchanged    however   we do see subtle hints of his transformation    one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash    the development of all of the characters   many of which is not included in this synopsis   is incredible    american movies   with rare exceptions   have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development    in its essence   this movie is about the development and growth of the characters   camille and stephane    the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie   including a death   is to further the development of camille s and stepahne s characters    i am not sure why berardinelli says     at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified   and it is to auteuil s credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty      this movie is not about judging stephane s actions as being right or wrong   but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are    i find the ending appropriate   unfortunately   i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling    this portion of the film is where the   sense of closure   could have been successfully accomplished    unfortunately   there is a hurried and almost a soap opera type surge of emotions from all of the characters    while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart   ravel has his day in this film    the synergism of the tension of ravel s music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen    the directing in this movie is wonderful    the actors and actresses are excellent   each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth    emmanuelle beart s personality is beautiful    and needless to say   i must say that emmanuelle beart   herself   is beautiful    besides the near ending   the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral    i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of    the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot   has their attitude towards love changed    i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at   but i am unsure of which the director is espousing    in summary   this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship    in the process   we see their attitude towards life and other people    in itself   i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie    where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we   as americans   have preconceived american notions of relationship   love   and people    i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture    however   i   bringing my american preconceptions   enjoyed the film    i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it    
Pos, the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber   the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse   and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest   little caper adventure entitled `where the money is      the elderly bank robber is henry   paul newman     a famous criminal that was only recently caught    he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune    always the shrewd thinker   he begins working on a plan to get out of jail    this involves years of studying buddhism and self hypnosis    when he is prepared to execute his plan   he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke    now a seemingly twitching vegetable   he is temporarily transferred to a state run home    carol   linda fiorentino   is the nurse that cares for him    she s a very bright person with a good heart    yet   her life is a miserable waste of time    the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars    her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics    worse   she s in a dead end relationship with high school sweetheart wayne   dylan mcdermott      they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom    to her   this made sense long ago    but now   it s a different story    wayne seems equally bored with his life   but is content enough to stay put    wayne s greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman    carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients   but she s never been anywhere else and doesn t see many other opportunities in life    however   when henry falls under her care   her outlook begins to change    the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke    carol   however   begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all    maybe she can get through to him   and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away    the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry   back to life      and what are some of carol s resuscitation techniques    perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses    if that fails   maybe she ll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20 foot high pier into the cold lake below    when he finally comes out of his state of self trance   the movie s direction changes   though it remains equally if not more entertaining    carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self assuredness    she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy    this   of course   puts wayne in an odd situation    henry and carol s bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car    henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash    meanwhile   this is carol s ticket to a better life    wayne is uncomfortable with the situation   but helps out nonetheless    however   his lack of commitment threatens their success    the heist sequence is suspenseful   well paced   and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong    `where the money is  does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist    newman is the real joy of the film   adroitly showing that at age 75   he s still really hot stuff    he possesses a sly smile   displays a dominating attitude   and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive    fiorentino is also a fun presence    you root for her despite her sense of amorality    sure   she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair stricken man into a lake   but we can see that to escape her dead end world   she needs to do something drastic    with two charismatic characters such as these   it s hard to ignore that `where the money is  is where the fun is    
Pos, robert benton has assembled a stellar   mature cast for his latest feature   twilight   a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood    paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross    harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames   gene hackman and susan sarandon     a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight    when jack sends him on a routine delivery job   however   the old instincts kick in    soon   harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line   and he no longer knows who to trust    there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight   in addition to newman   hackman and sarandon    james garner plays raymond hope   a former cop and one of harry s best friends    stockard channing plays verna   harry s former partner   and possibly a former love interest    reese witherspoon is mel   the distrustful daughter of the ames    and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend    giancarlo esposito appears as harry s bumbling detective protigi   and john spencer is a suspicious police captain    with a cast like that   it s almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze    luckily   there s more to the film than some sort of actor s recognition ceremony    twilight has a solid film noir ish plot    it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics   but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days    the major cast members all deliver strong performances   as can be expected of their caliber    however   none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable    the supporting cast is enjoyable   if a little underdrawn    stockard channing s character   in particular   is a cipher    there s more to her character than the film takes the time to describe    it s a minor   but irritating   flaw    with a solid cast   and a good plot   there s a lot to recommend about twilight    it s biggest flaw is actually its short running time    at a slim 94 minutes   there s a lot of stuff that s packed into an awfully small package    still   the chance to see newman   sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two    
Pos, warning   anyone offended by blatant   leering machismo had better avoid this film    or lots of blood & guts   men against men and mano et mano stuff    in other words   it s a walter hill film !  with a john milius script !  i always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between arm wrestling matches    these films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with   probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb    and we got tough guys galore   here   drug running banditos by the dozens   all dirty and sweaty and pretty ill tempered   overall   a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to cover up   supposedly   any connection between the government and the drug runners   and lots of shit kicking texas dirt farmers who d as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you    in particular   we got nick nolte as one hard ass texas ranger   powers boothe as the drug kingpin   michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army   and rip torn as the local sheriff    torn is the sympathetic figure of the group   he smiles before shooting anyone    as to women        well   i ve never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film   and at this rate   i doubt i ever will    women exist here to look good   comfort the man   and get argued over    gosh !  just like the old days        frankly   this is a pretty good movie   if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff    the cinematography is excellent   the cast of characters is broad and has texture   the script is quite good   and the film lets you keep up with what s happening yourself   without spelling it out to you    i appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up    finally   there s lots of sam peckinpah slow motion shoot ups    
Pos, accepting his oscar as producer of this year s best picture winner   saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over    one could almost say the same about his much prized film    rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery   symbolism   ideas and metaphors   complex and literate storytelling   all possessed of an intelligence that invites    even demands    constant scrutiny   an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth    in short   the antithesis of all things hollywood    yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind    ralph fiennes is the title character   an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory   and particularly the memory of love   is the ostensible focus of the film    but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together   we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him    his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld    the same can easily be said for every other character in the film   of which there are too many    juliette binoche s nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart    at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her   and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious   disfigured   dying stranger    even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion   however   that it verges on the comical    with so many characters enjoying so little screen time   the film s 160 minutes can be taxing    yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn t help but feel that greatness was in the air    hints of it were everywhere    in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover   in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern day swimmer in the sahara   in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war    there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years    but ultimately the emotional truths writer director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed    in the end   i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron   a haunting bore    bore is perhaps too strong a word    but after drinking in the rich production values   the cup remains only slightly over half full    
Pos, a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates   a film which was based on the best seller by george v     higgins    it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51 year old   small time hood   eddie   fingers   coyle   mitchum      he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment    his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3 5 year stretch in new hampshire   something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn t think he could survive prison at his age    he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare    he could have cut a deal and gotten off   if he turned his boss over to the d   a     but he figured he would never live if he did that    he is currently gun running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise   rocco      the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager s house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it    on one of the heists   they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm    coyle s best friend is dillon   boyle     a hit man for the mob   working as a bartender    he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents   as an aggressive young agent named foley   jordan     who likes to be called uncle   gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record   as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs    with the sentencing date closing in on him   the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time    he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain    thinking he made an iron clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire   he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down   knowing full well the young hustler   keats   selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence    but foley tells him after he arrests the gun dealer   that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence   they want him to be a full time informer    warning   spoiler follows in next paragraph    the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend    the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up    coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says     to be young like that and have his future   he s the greatest hockey player in the world      dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob style   having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston    this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets   of the hopeless situation the low level criminals are in   and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next    the city streets are ugly   the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests   whether it is betrayal or murder    there is a fatalistic feel about their lives   something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat    mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs   as it overcomes a thin plot    it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them    mitchum is a loser   and   that he lived so long   is a tribute to his skills as a survivor    but in the end   he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy   as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle    
Pos,    footloose   has only one goal in mind   to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel good antics    and i hate to admit it   i fell for it    the movie is about a teenager   bacon   who moves to a small town from the big city   and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend   lithgow      he ends up falling for the preacher s daughter   singer   and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do    as mentioned at the beginning of this review     footloose   is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama    there are virtually no surprises   and the writing is second rate    so why did i enjoy it so much    for one thing   the cast is great    kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role    we re rooting for him right from the start   and   unlike most films of this genre   bacon doesn t play him as the   rebel without a clue   sort    yes   he does rebel   but he s also polite when he needs to be    and he never broods    the rest of the cast is equally impressive    john lithgow   seen here playing a normal guy for a change   is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian    but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter    by the end of the film   we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character    another nice touch is the music    we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with   sexual innuendos     but that s not true at all    the title track   performed by kenny loggins   is upbeat and fun    during the final sequence   i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing    of course   i soon realized that would be a little pathetic    anyway     footloose   is a charming little surprise    don t let the premise prevent you from watching it    it sucked me in   and it ll do the same to you    
Pos, as i walked out of crouching tiger   hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film    with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a   great   piece of work and viceversa    attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs    i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology    as the word implies   a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master    as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality    crouching tiger   hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category    crouching tiger   hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore   with the requisite blend of legend   fantasy   magic and mythology    it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half gods   greater than life   purer than life   stronger than life   physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats   but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable    all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix   including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement    the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop   with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil   which must choose between the two    it is the gifted pupil who   under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend    the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment   a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters   are poignantly represented    the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively    the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours de force   not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art   as are the prodigious leaps and flights to   from and between rooftops   the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake    there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry    as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line   which takes place at an ordinary human level   yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy    do not assume   however   that the art is limp wristed    for those who are put off by the   art   label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure   action and romance    there are no weak performances in this movie    michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth   humanity and wisdom    chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart    zhang ziyi is a budding superstar    she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role    cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably    kudos to screenwriters james schamus   wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing   choreographer yuen wo ping   photography director peter pau and music director tan dun   each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film    ang lee as the director   co producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit    this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes   including those who hate martial arts movies    don t miss it    
Pos,    crazy/beautiful   suffers from the damned if you do   damned if you don t syndrome    after a spate of flighty   cookie cutter teen films   the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story    but rather than applaud the production   early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown   afterschool special      even worse   in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people   the studio got a case of the heebie jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re shoot scenes and cut footage to   tone things down      needless to say   the filmmaker was frustrated       we were trying to make a cautionary tale     he told newsweek     and we couldn t show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from      regardless   the film works   thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes       crazy/beautiful   is quality fare   good enough that i half expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for   failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes      set in pacific palisades   calif     the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens    every morning and evening   carlos nunez   jay hernandez   takes a two hour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school    an honor student and star athlete   carlos is responsible   modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy    all is well until he meets nicole oakley   kirsten dunst     the daughter of a rich congressman   bruce davison      nicole is a drunk apparently hell bent on self destruction    carlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her   but he is only human and she has the greatest smile    plus   as her father notes   she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral    as with   save the last dance       crazy/beautiful     god   how i hate lower case titles   takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh    while noting the racial and social differences between the kids   the screenplay dances around most of the clich   s   there are still several mtv moments   though      the filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there    cute as a button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicole s behavior    she is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down   i hoped the boy would listen    as carlos   hernandez is a revelation    hunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team   the young man can really act   we will see a lot of this guy in the future    aside from its title   the biggest problem with   crazy/beautiful   is its ending   which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy    after carefully presenting credible characters and situations   the conclusion feels rushed and lazy    still   this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots       afterschool special   my ass     crazy/beautiful   is the real deal    
Pos, everyone knows someone like giles de ath   stuffy   arrogant   set in his ways   and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with   progress      giles is a writer   but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis    his house looks like an immaculate museum   with no television   microwave   word processor   or other technological gadgets   only the electric lights betray that he s living in the twentieth century   not the nineteenth    this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype   but john hurt   in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career   turns   erstwhile fogy   giles into a three dimensional human being    despite his tunnel vision   it s impossible not to like the man   especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune   love    and   as giles discovers during the course of this amusing   warm hearted motion picture   it s possible to find the object of one s affection in the most unusual places    giles   who is a widower and a recluse   does not frequent the cinema   but when he learns that an e   m   forster film is playing at the local theater   he screws up his courage and decides to go    what he doesn t realize is that the movie house is showing two films   the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii    a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress    just as giles is about to leave   however   he notices ronnie bostock   jason priestley     and   suddenly   it s love at first sight    giles is enraptured   and the moment hotpants college ii is over   he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia   including teen magazines and video tapes       in order to watch those tapes   giles must buy a vcr   but he initially doesn t realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr      eventually   not satisfied with being the world s foremost authority on bostock   giles boards a plane and travels to long island   where his idol s home is located    bostock is away when giles arrives   but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie s supermodel girlfriend   audrey   fiona loewi      eventually   the actor arrives home and   impressed with giles  demeanor and intelligence   he begins to rely on the older man s advice    but   while giles  affection runs deep   ronnie s feelings are less constant    love and death on long island is a comedy   and a very funny one at that    in fact   for its first half   the film is nearly perfect    it suffers a fall off once giles reaches new york   and the ending   with its none too subtle homosexual overtones   is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it    in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom   writer/director richard kwietniowski   adapting from the novel by gilbert adair   is 100% on  target    in the process   he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles   but says a few things about the transforming power of love   even if it is unrequited    from start to finish   this is clearly hurt s movie   he s in almost every frame    it s a role that the veteran actor must have relished   because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure   and does so by means of dialogue delivery   body language   and ever changing facial expressions    jason priestley   cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image   is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie    he is charismatic   and it s not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie    meanwhile   solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always reliable maury chaykin    love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one   a social commentary   it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment     a buddy picture/love story   ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days     and a   fish out of water   tale   victorian relic giles forced into the modern world      yet   despite the many laughs love and death offers   it never takes cheap shots    it has a vibrant   beating heart   and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile

Pos, meet joe black   reviewed on nov   27/98    starring brad pitt   anthony hopkins   claire forlani  in   meet joe black     brad pitt plays death    that s all that really needs to be said   but nevertheless   i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description    death decides to take a holiday   what with all the rigors of soul collecting and all   and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it s like to be human    death assumes the body of brad pitt   and from there   much trouble ensues    for one thing   death as pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter   played by claire forlani    obviously this enrages hopkins   because really   what can death offer    besides eternal damnation   of course    there is also a sub plot about forlani s ex boyfriend   she dumps him for pitt   trying to take over hopkins company       meet joe black   runs just under three hours    i ve always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics       meet joe black   is neither historical nor is it an epic   though i get the feeling martin brest   the director   desperately wants it to be    every single scene in the movie goes on about 3 4 minutes too long    and the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should    a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent   instead of just good   which is what it is    pitt   an actor i normally loathe   is actually quite engaging as death    i believed his performance   and i could see why forlani s character would fall in love with him    i have to agree with roger ebert   though   who found it hard to believe that an entity that s been around for all time wouldn t know what peanut butter was    that has nothing to do with pitt s performance   of course   but it is a little distracting    hopkins gives his usual excellent performance    he s able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left   without making him an obnoxious whiner    and in her first major studio role   claire forlani is surprisingly good    she has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her    so     meet joe black   is a good movie hampered by it s ridiculous running time    had the film been cut by an hour or so   i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review    
Pos, call it touched by a demon    gregory hoblit s fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual   horrific twist    if marketed properly   this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim   dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven    in fact   there s even a little twin peaks to be found here   albeit with the lion s share of the weirdness distilled out       remember bob      the biggest failing of fallen is that   although it s consistently interesting   it s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope    a serial killer   elias koteas   has been on the loose in philadephia   but detective john hobbes   denzel washington     the noblest man on the police force   has brought him to justice    now   during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber   the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes     what goes around really goes around      shortly thereafter   he begins to sing   time is on my side   as he s taken on his last walk    minutes later   the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead    but for hobbes   the nightmare is just beginning   because reese wasn t a normal psychopath   he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel    and   with reese s death   azazel is free to hop from body to body   murdering and wreaking havoc at will    only hobbes and a pretty   female theology teacher   embeth davidtz   have an inkling of what they re up against    the rest of the cops   including hobbes  partner   jonesy   john goodman     lou   james gandolfini     a newcomer to the department   and lieutenant stanton   donald sutherland     don t have a clue   and   as a result   they are in mortal danger    as depicted by hoblit   primal fear   and cinematographer newton thomas sigel   philadelphia is a dark   dreary place   a gothic city rather than a modern one    no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown    the most famous landmark to appear isn t the liberty bell or independence hall   it s geno s steaks    shadows and night scenes abound    the days are cloudy and unpromising    this is the kind of setting where it s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men    fallen s plot is brimming with potential   not all of which is realized    somehow   i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise    but the level of terror   like that of gore   is kept in check    nevertheless   there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks    the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual    of the several dozen actors to play azazel   the best is by far elias koteas   exotica   crash     who   despite only being on screen for about ten minutes   gives a fantastically charged performance    john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself   although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick    sadly   however   these two are the only ones who excel    everyone else   including denzel washington   is boring    washington s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film    it s not that he s bad per se   but he s not very interesting    there s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character   and that keeps us distanced   however slightly   from hobbes    as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop   and as his life or death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate   i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was    washington s subdued approach is part of the reason for this   i never felt a sense of urgency    however   at least washington was believable   which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz   schindler s list   and donald sutherland    to be fair   the flaws in their characters aren t all acting related   neither stanton nor gretta milano are well written    that said   however   there s nothing inspired about either davidtz s or sutherland s work    both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts   as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi dimensional individual    narratively   fallen has a few glaring weaknesses    although the plot proceeds with a convoluted   game like structure   it uses a denzel washington supplied voiceover to overexplain matters    at times   this is actually helpful   and it has a use beyond the obvious   but there are occasions when ponderous lines like   i like the night   sometimes you come face to face with yourself   become a little hard to swallow    in addition   fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland   generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel    however   despite the negatives   i m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending   which i loved    the final scenes are startling   audacious   and unexpected    it s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did    at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes   fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself    this is not a great motion picture   but   considering how bad most january releases are   it s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours    and   whatever you do   don t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll    
Pos, james l   brooks   one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news   returns to the big screen with this entertaining   if slightly flawed comedy    nicholson plays melvin udall   probably the most horrible person ever on the screen    he s racist   homophobic   and never has a good word to say to anyone    so   nobody talks to him   except waitress carol conelly   t   v  sitcom star hunt   who was last seen in twister   1996      naturally   udall   conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop   kinnear   who nicholson hates   all hit it off in the end    like good will hunting   1997   and titanic   1997     even though the outcome is completely obvious   as good as it gets is an enjoyable   funny and warm comedy    nicholson is hilarious as melvin   churning out insults with superb relish    only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers    hunt is also good as waitress carol   and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson    there s also   thankfully   a bit of chemistry between them    kinnear   as the gay neighbor   seems to have a slightly underwritten role   he s more of a plot convience than a character    although his performance is good   his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together    in fact   the scene stealer is simon s dog   who is funnier than nicholson    but then again   pets are always cute on screen    providing solid support is cuba gooding   jnr   jerry maguire   1996   and yeardly smith   who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons   although gooding isn t as good as is character in maguire   he is still fun    he overacts a little   but not so much as to be annoying    smith is also good   although she has a fairly small role    even director lawrence kasdan   body heat   1981   makes an appearance as a doctor    but this is primarily nicholsons film   and every scene he s in   he s steals it    he s character is so hateful   though   it s amazing that anyone talks to him at all   especially carol    and this is the films main problem    it s totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin    she doesn t fall in love with him naturally   the film forces her to fall in love with him    also   melvins character seems to go too nice   too quickly    i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice   loving person    it would take a helluva long time   much longer than this film would like to make out    brooks direction is good   though   if a bit average   but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience    he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones   he tends to pile on to much schmaltz   but generally he s good    there s also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer    but   generally   as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do   which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie    the movie is a bit overlong   but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly    overall   as good as it gets is a fun movie   even though it may be unbelivable   and certainly worth seeing   if just for jack nicholsons performance      not quite as good as it gets   pardon the bad joke     but still good fun    
Pos, after a stylistic detour with mrs    parker and the vicious circle   which   despite its uncomfortable tone   was close to being a conventional movie     director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow   a romantic black comedy about love   betrayal   and self absorption    while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture   rudolph s atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing   if not always pleasant   movie    it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director   meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it    until mrs    parker   i had not been overly impressed by his movies    i found equinox   his last pre  mrs    parker effort   to be irritating and frustrating    i was somewhat surprised   therefore   to discover that i liked afterglow    there are several reasons for this   but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident   mannered aspects of his approach    the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems   the story is absorbing   and the acting is top notch    in short   rudolph has created a world that it s worth spending two hours in    afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples    jeffrey byron   jonny lee miller   is a cold   seemingly heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife   marianne   lara flynn boyle      for her part   marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level    all she s interested in is seducing him during those few days when she s ovulating    after he refuses to make love   she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor    the other couple   lucky   nick nolte   and phyllis mann   julie christie     are an older pair   but they re no more content than jeffrey and marianne    a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart    they remain married as a matter of convenience   but   since phyllis won t allow lucky to touch her   they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs    the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable    the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey    the two of them are immediately attracted to one another   and it doesn t take long before they re lounging together   naked   in her pool    meanwhile   jeffrey   who is captivated by older women   runs into phyllis in a hotel bar   is smitten   and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains    the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love    sex means something different to everyone   to jeffrey   it s an unpleasant chore   a loss of control   to marianne   it s a means to a maternal end   to lucky   it s an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles   and to phyllis   it s a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness    ultimately   none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves    the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script   but in the performances    jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish   callous   suit and tie businessman    those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity    lara flynn boyle   who wasn t impressive in rudolph s equinox   is greatly improved   making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability    nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky   and he manages to deliver some of rudolph s most pregnant lines with practiced ease    the clear standout   however   is julie christie   who is nothing short of delicious as the world weary phyllis    her often wry   occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film s humor   and there s hardly ever a moment when she doesn t steal the spotlight from her co stars    i don t know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph  detractors   but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director s earlier productions    enough of his trademark style remains   however   to reassure his supporters    afterglow is basically a four pronged character study    the plot is not especially compelling   but the character interaction is   and that s the real reason to see this motion picture    rudolph has painted an able picture of the non romantic side of love    the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction    
Pos,    the fugitive   is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made    it takes realistic   believable characters and tells an exciting story that s totally believable throughout    this isn t an over the top action flick for the sake of action   this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly    harrison ford stars as dr   richard kimble   a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife    the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder   but is not told in a straightforward manner    we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble s perspective    hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble s wife   helen   sela ward   was murdered    we don t get to see who the killer is until much further into the story    in fact   we might even have a little doubt about kimble s innocence ourselves    the film doesn t spend much time on the details of kimble s trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story    one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck    but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated   it is actually suspenseful to watch    this movie is so incredible because it s able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable    tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard   a u   s   marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives    from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur    kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other    most of the film deals with richard s complex investigation as he tries to find the one armed man who killed his wife    ford does not have a lot of lines here   so it is stuart and twohy s script and davis s outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is    just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits   disguising himself   and doing his own detective work is very interesting    we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed   so as he learns more so do we    meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down    at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues   but richard is just too smart for them    he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery    one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor    there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo   pantoliano   and biggs   roebuck      they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer   yet they constantly start up small talk with each other   making funny wisecracks and one liners   but not in any kind of distracting manner    the final act concludes with another terrific chase    richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him   and although we get a typical fight scene   the case is far from solved    the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along   and we don t realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together    maybe the finally scene is a bit much   but it still has a believable atmosphere to it    we re so relieved when justice is served    it s not the plot is that makes   the fugitive   great   it s all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story    watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous    if only hollywood could produce more movies like this       10/31/96     1/29/97     6/13/97   [see also     nick of time   ]  
Pos, i think that any competent member of the human race who s ever seen a movie  any movie  could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer    even though i try very hard to not predict films as i m watching them   especially not romantic comedies     the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds   and sometimes minutes   before i actually saw it happen on screen    but i don t care    not even a little    my reasons for this are simple   1   adam sandler is great    2   drew barrymore is great    3   the movie is so funny    there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard    i haven t laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers    sandler plays robby hart   a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music    in the opening scenes   he seems like a happy go lucky wedding singer   at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual   steve buscemi   who decides that his brother s wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life   up to that point   was utter pointlessness    a week later   at his own wedding   he is left standing at the altar by his ex fianc   e   linda   angela featherstone      with his life in complete disarray   he meets julia   barrymore     a waitress    she is engaged to glenn   matthew glave     and is to marry him in about three months    julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans    soon   and predictably   it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk   and that robby and julia really love each other    oh sure   it s trite    and if anyone making this film expected us to   like   feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer   then they truly underestimated their audience    what makes the story bearable   aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music   are the performances    barrymore is simply adorable here   i ve never seen her look so close to the way she did in et      not only is she pleasant to look at   but her acting job here really is a good one  and it doesn t hurt that the character is likable and adequately well written    and the jerk   played in full force by graves   is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i ve ever seen    naturally   the true star here is sandler    i think the guy is flat out hilarious    he can say something that just isn t funny   and his delivery makes me laugh    his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore   but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can   indeed   hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy    whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler   the wedding singer gives him a character that   for the first time   he actually has to fit into    as far as i m concerned he succeeded   and this film is testimony that he does   in fact   have some range in his talents    and the movie is just so funny    perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc   e abandoned him    this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air    and while the film   like all romantic comedies   takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up   there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half    my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren t very important    the film is predicable   but who cares    the characters are extremely likable   the movie is ridiculously funny   and the experience is simply enjoyable    in addition to this   i can t imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film    in that order   i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review    i just want everyone to know that i laughed    a lot    
Pos, based on the boris karloff s classic by the same name   the mummy starts off with the high priest of osiris   imhotep   who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible    bandaged up   having his tongue removed   and being covered in flesh eating scarab beetles   then entombed       all while still alive    recap a few thousand years later   where a soldier named rick   played by brandan fraser   aids a young historian named evelyn   played by rachel wiesz   and her brother   jonathan   played by john hannah   in finding the book of amon ra   in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy    problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress   using evelyn as a sacrifice        walking in with relatively low expectations   i thought this movie was actually pretty good    the visuals and cgi are astounding   and obviously not cheaply done at all    they pack a ton of detail into the images   especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi    the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes   such as unnerving moments involving flesh eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him   after all   those who took his artifacts are cursed      unfortunately   the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time   becoming a tug of war for control between genres    on one hand   it is a fast paced action film    on the other   it s a frightening horror film    and on the side   it s a hilarious comedy    ideally   for it to be successful   the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect   with one character serving as the comic relief   that would be johnson      the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief   with rick occasionally delivering his witty one liner    if they were trying to make a horror action comedy   it would have helped if it were established early on in the film   but unfortunately   with the backstory of imhotep s entombment   that would be impossible    and then there s the slapstick fight scene between a sword wielding rick and an army of mummies    while really well done   it had the feel of slapstick comedy    replace the sword with a chainsaw and you d effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness    while entertaining and funny   it feels really out of place    but at least it s a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of    on the whole   the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end   entertaining the audience    but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners       turn  the sound down !  while a lot of theatres have good sound systems   my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre   the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you re not careful      when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film     end of days     it was so loud i couldn t make anything out    
Pos, on re watching italian writer/director dario argento s much lauded murder mystery tenebrae   i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with    in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles   but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his   giallo   murder mysteries    while it s certainly not perfect   repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller    the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal   anthony franciosa   where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book   tenebrae      with the police on his back for leads   he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems    the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa    he brings grace   charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real life horror around him    the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension    argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral   ambivalent   shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business    tenebrae is perhaps the most multi layered of argento s scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here    it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play    in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso   the full length italian language version   and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes    needless to say for argento fans   there is no denying the director s brilliance as a stylist    many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork    they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light   rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria    instead   tenebrae s set design and lighting paints a sleek   clinical   chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world    and the soundtrack s mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment    so tenebrae has much to recommend it   no question    still   constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative    some critics argue that logic doesn t matter in argento films   but damnit   it matters in all films to the point where viewers don t deserve to feel cheated    by the way   if you don t want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs    about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which   properly handled   could have proved ingenious    we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who   we later discover   is none other than the author peter neal    he is insane   apparently    the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it s time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife    he is finally revealed to us as this   second killer   in the film s bloody climax    but argento muffs the twist   both technically and narratively    you see   we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer s house    but thanks to poor editing   its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway    bad cutting puts the timing way out    in other words   he s almost in two places at once    during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring    by the film s end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant    the injury    he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock !  thus   the revelation of the   hero   as a killer   and anti hero   in the final scenes may still prove shocking   but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled    helpfully   in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along    but there too is a problem   as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least    the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa s mind   his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage    tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies    for instance   a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike    we would assume the rider is the same boy   but it turns out to be some male character we aren t even introduced too !  that s careless filmmaking   pure and simple    why   you may ask   do i go on about the story s flaws    because when it comes to visuals and set pieces   argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world    take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae    an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where   almost unbelievably   it jumps a high fence and chases her across town    finally   as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine   she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer s lair    it s an absolutely masterful sequence   tense and exciting   and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone    and that s exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating    too often   it seems   argento s films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts    mind you   if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look    and if you re a fan of argento s unique style of giallo thriller then it s essential    see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli    it s a stylish   great looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative    a shame   because it doesn t have to be that way    take argento s more recent stendhal syndrome   1992     where with the aid of co writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache    proof that he can do it   if he tries        
Pos, as any sociologist will attest   your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult    parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives    but if your upbringing is marred with violence   hate and dysfunctionality   then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome    `affliction  explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood    the man in question is wade whitehouse   nick nolte      here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface    he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me    but as you scratch beneath the surface   something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head    we see that he is a mean tempered person    he has a hard time taking control of his emotions   which usually gets the better of him    he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person   but something is sparking a tendency towards violence    he also has tremendous problems with relationships    he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter    but his bearish persona and stature alienates her    he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him    his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl   sissy spacek   at risk    she tries to remain true to him and supportive   but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person   relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point    finally   he is spiteful and vindictive    as a rejected father   he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless    as the town s only police officer   he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died    we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain    he is a prisoner and a slave to it    he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension    what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him    we learn that the answer is his father   james coburn      this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet    he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist    we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks    to heighten the father s churlishness   the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person    very effective    today   wade s dad is quite elderly   but still manages to instill fear into a grown man    the influence that the father possesses is inescapable   and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade    the result is every son s nightmare   becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be    this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama   and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity    he s a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father    coburn displays heft as the bitter dad    but   it s most certainly not saturday night friendly fare    there s nothing light or fluffy about this film    that may turn many moviegoers away    but it s certainly worth noting that this is a well acted drama showcasing nolte s and coburn s raw acting talents    
Pos, is evil dead ii a bad movie    it s full of terrible acting   pointless violence   and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release    explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots   including the original evil dead   is extremely difficult    `well what s it about      `five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly   hairy   wart covered monsters      `come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week    why should i see it again      `no evil dead ii is different   it s funny      `it s funny to see people die    are you sick or something      maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie    his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle   as disturbing as it is hilarious    an example of raimi s odd approach   a monster   formerly protagonist ash s girlfriend of all people   is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound    sure it s over the top   but it is so over the top that it is laugh out loud funny   just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood   staining his face and knocking him back a few feet    the whole movie is like this   watch ash get beat up   watch ash defeat the monster   watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster    the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets   the more amusing it becomes    no matter how sick it may sound   it is funny to watch bruce ampbell s ash get his butt kicked every five minutes    and raimi takes advantage   he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend   by the body of an old lady   even by his own right hand    like the less superior idle hands   we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part    but it doesn t end   ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family    all of these events   thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster  like camera movements   at first become shocking   then inexplicably funny    raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses   he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers  duck soup   then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off    with a running time of less than an hour and a half   raimi gets away with the impossible   making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares    ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series   raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn t wait to make it s sequel    
Pos, it s rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year   but that is what disney and pixar animation   s latest film represents    while a bugs life isn t nearly as deep as it s predecessor   dreamwork s antz   it is just as funny    a bug s life centers   appropriately   around the life of an ant   named flik    flik   cutely voiced by newsradio s david foley   hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task    when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost   the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way    the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them    the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper   who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey    when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food    when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission   they never dream he will be successful   they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food    flik s mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return    instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs   who he mistakenly assumes are warriors    when he returns with the `warriors    the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes    a bug s life has animation that is simply stunning    the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative    together with the great voice acting   this film is the perfect holiday family film    its main weakness is that it couldn t beat antz to the theaters   making it seem like stale material    
Pos, not since oliver stone s natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary   and not since david cronenberg has a so called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility    while fincher s films have never suffered from a lack of shock value   his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples     fight club marks the distillation of his pitch black comedic sensibility   see 1997 s the game   into something like a definitive statement    jack   norton   acting as both narrator and protagonist   is your typical cubicle clone   whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia    on the offhand advice of a doctor   he sits in on group therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer    here he meets bob   marvin lee aday   aka meat loaf     a cancer emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia    strangely   the release he finds while sobbing on bob s breasts allows him to sleep at night   at least until a fellow group therapy   tourist   named marla singer   carter   comes along to ruin things for him   forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity    later   he meets tyler durden   pitt     a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life    one night   after his ikea  furnished condo explodes   don t ask   you ll just have to see the movie   awright       he is goaded by tyler into a fight   and damned if it doesn t feel good    it is pure   raw existence   a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison    he moves into tyler s squalid abandoned mansion   and they form the titular organization   an underground therapy group where men bond with bare knuckle savagery and very few rules   the first two of which are   don t talk about fight club      armed with charisma and an attractive anti corporate philosophy   tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white collar slaves and dead end mcemployees    resentment creeps into jack s heart   made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla    funded by a frivolous lawsuit   tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem    their initially juvenile pranks   like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads   quickly evolve into something more like sedition   and jack fears that things have gone sour    it is after this point   when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original   that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist    it is so contrived   and so conventional compared to what precedes it   that everything which follows   including the ending   becomes far less interesting    it s a major   though not fatal   flaw   and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher   it feels like a cop out    fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people    in the early going   it has a downright dangerous feel   it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul   and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it    i ll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don t spring up here and there   and i ll be even more amazed if fincher isn t vilified for it by the same humorless witch hunters that are currently after oliver stone    they needn t bother   because fight club is less a message movie than fincher s elaborate attempt at a joke    tyler durden   for all his dionysian allure   is really nothing more than the logical   and far less hypocritical   extrapolation of all those self help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me first gospel of self actualization    in this context   the joke works   but like the latest columbine joke   some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh   and others won t    hopefully   though   their silly moral outrage won t spoil the joke for the rest of us    
Pos, plot   a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention    the boys eventually get together to split the money   but as plans change   double crosses occur   dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road    who s on the up and up   who s the real bad guy and who s gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie    critique   the funnest movie that i ve seen so far this year !  it s got style   it s got tough guys talkin  shite and it s got plenty of bullets to go around    a definite hunk a hunk a burnin  adventure !  a guy s guy movie through and through   and one that ll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff    it s not very original   it goes on for a little too long   but costner and russell make it happen   as two shite kickin  elvis lovers   who don t stop till they   more or less   drop    this movie s got some pretty intensive shoot out scenes   one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i ve ever witnessed   featuring several elvises with guns a blazin  and the king s music playing in the background   and a decent helping of double crosses   sharp dialogue and funny moments    in fact   even though the cast is filled with many name actors   b actors as they might be for the most part     most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim    but the true glue that holds this film together   other than the spirit of elvis himself   is costner and russell   who play their badass characters to the t   sure   russell s been down this road before   but costner surprised me with his nastiness    i guess he s pissed at all the box office bombs that he s been in of late   but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here    in the end   the bottom line with this movie is having fun   kickin  ass and making sure there s enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards    and smoke  em if you got  em   folks !  there is also this one really great show down scene between costner and a cop   that ll have you crackin  up and lovin  it all at the same time    the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that ll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next    it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background   with plenty   and i mean plenty   of camera tricks   cuts and edits   but for this kind of flick   it actually works    the film is not perfect though   it starts off with a pretty big bang   but then pulls a way of the gun on us   and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle   while characters intermingle and disperse    i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots   and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well    and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega hot in the movie    no       okay    well i just did !  i coulda done without her whole   romance   angle   but to be honest   it doesn t take up much of the film   which is generally covered in blood   explosions   guts and elvis nods    try to see how many   inside   connections to the king you can guess    of course   it s no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind    i also like these types of   guy   movies a lot   and even though the film doesn t bring much originality to the table   it does offer a pretty coherent story   some nice twists and turns   humor and a big ol  helping of whoop ass coming straight from costner and russell s respective boots    probably not a film for everyone   but definitely for those who enjoy the guns   the charismatic bad guys and a fun   if entirely disposable   adventure    now see how many elvis songs i ve used to pun my way through this phony review below    the elvis songs also recommend this movie !  so whether you re lonesome tonight or any other night   remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets   leave your little sister at home   bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse   cause this movie ain t one to return to the sender    i really beg of you   whether you re stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel   to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender    and no suspicious minds either   folks   cause i got stung by this movie   i mean it really shook me up   and unless you re the devil in disguise himself   i think you won t be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either    so don t be cruel   don t turn away   don t curl up with your latest flame tonite   whether she be a hard headed woman or not   and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film    it s now or never   folks    trust me   i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i d seen so far this year is far behind me    joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building    thank you       thank  you very much ! !  where s joblo coming from    get carter   7/10     heat   8/10     honeymoon in vegas   9/10     payback   8/10     reindeer games   5/10    reservoir dogs   9/10     way of the gun   6/10    
Pos, >from the commercials   this looks like a mild mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight    instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end    the concept is deceptively pedestrian    an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way    the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea    the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents    following one dead end lead after another   each funnier than the previous   they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents   alan alda and lily tomlin    it s difficult to condense the mile a minute plot    seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one    without giving too much away   one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol   tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion    and it s all done in a fairly clean   almost   well   maybe not exactly   family fare manner    a grand cast   tomlin   alda   moore   ben stiller   patricia arquette   tea leoni   george segal   interacts in a seamless parade of laughs    drawing from a more hyper woody allen style   the film succeeds beyond expectations    
Pos, i m not quite sure how best to go about writing this review    i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson s political satire   wag the dog     but in retrospect   this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it    quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through   and it didn t do that    they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all too true attack on the way the american political media works   and it didn t quite do that either    a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick s   dr    strangelove   in the tradition of political black comedy   and it most definitely didn t do that    that said     wag the dog   is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them    the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean   robert deniro   to distract the american public from the accusations that the president   who is up for re election in two weeks   sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office    the accusations   the script suggests   are probably untrue   but as brean so pointedly puts it   that isn t particularly relevant   the scandal is likely to derail the president s campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood    brean   along with his assistant   anne heche     decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss   dustin hoffman   to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special effects trickery to make it appear that the u   s   is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor    as i said     wag the dog   is not quite as laugh out loud hilarious as i had expected   but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here   such as when   in an echo of a familiar movie clich     the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting   inspirational music   then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform   we have the right to fight for democracy      another scene shows us how   with modern editing equipment   an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village    the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team s attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt    william   old shoe   schumann   woody harrelson     an ex military officer who turns out to be a first class psycho    of course   not everything goes as planned   the cia   for example   realizes what s going on and strikes a deal with the president s electoral opponent to report to the media that the   fighting   has ended   forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis    still   even with the cia s involvement   the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable    regardless of the official word from the president or the cia   wouldn t the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is   in fact   no fighting going on in albania    the film never addresses this question   nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical   such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt    schumann   we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it    there was also an instance   towards the end of the film   in which one of motss s forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away    with these plot holes     wag the dog   doesn t quite work as a satire of american politics   but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place    brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical   rather   they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off    the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end   as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret    motss and his hollywood buddies   meanwhile   seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project    in fact   one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss s increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war   in his mind   it is the greatest work of art he has ever created    i think it s fair to say that   wag the dog   underachieves a little bit   more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four star film and a classic satire    still   the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one    wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks   what if the war wasn t even real    with this premise and the talented cast   the film still delivers more consistently than most   whatever its flaws    
Pos, the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible    people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized   methodical hatred    five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days   the first documentary from steven spielberg s survivors of the shoah visual history foundation    the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry    as the introduction explains   even as germany started to lose the war   the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe    in 1944   hungary had the last big population of jews within germany s reach   and they became the last target of hitler s   final solution      each of the five tells his or her story    their stories are intercut chronologically   starting from normal life in pre war hungary    they recall the nazi invasion of hungary   being sent to   work   camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps    they recall their horrible   precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald   the deaths of their family and friends   their loss of hope    each recalls his or her unfathomable   eventual liberation    and finally   the last days shows their cathartic   pained   modern day return to their old homes and the camps    needless to say   their stories are horrifying   amazing   and emotionally draining    by themselves   the stories would be forceful testaments   but by cutting them in parallel   their impact is multiplied by five    the last days is a talking heads style documentary    it s mostly pictures of people telling their stories   intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage    in this kind of movie it s almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on screen   but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific   or at least relevant   images to go with his subjects  narration    the liner notes   one of the many nice features of this dvd   indicate that there is some never before seen historical footage in the last days    it s not clear which scene it is    it could be one of two that i hadn t seen before   both powerful    one is rare color footage   shot by an american   of piles of victims in cattle cars    there is something jarring   something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color   when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white    another segment shows walking skeletons   survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore    there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say    but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war   moll told a specific part of the story in a new way   in greater detail    and i m glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject    the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful    x mozilla status   0009f words for a holocaust documentary   but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring   when skies are blue and trees are green    also   the movie was shot on 35mm film   and not video !      so the richness and detail are impeccable    the dvd s features are plentiful and well chosen    there is a theatrical trailer for the movie   which is a great introduction to the subject matter    there are about fifty still photos   both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors    also   the disc has two complete versions of the movie   widescreen and full screen     both on the same side    one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors   plus one for the crew      you d think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary   but they re not bloopers    instead   they are solid   moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length    one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film    renee firestone   one of the five   spoke on camera with dr   hans m   nch   a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz    firestone was aggressive   questioning the doctor about what his children thought    the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable    another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz    he ends his prayer by saying         forgive me for surviving      it s ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film    it s ambitious to make it on a subject that has saturated cable   television   and movies    it s ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers    but the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well    it s only fitting that the dvd   with its wealth of interesting and relevant features   would also be ambitious and successful    
Pos, it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child   whether that may be in life or in death    after having said that   i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well    one gets that choking sensation in the throat   because of grief   when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake   or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement    there is no ocean   no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another   ordinary people     in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing   not that this literally happened in the movie      so what are the lessons learnt   1    don t take your children to class reunions    2   don t leave them alone in the lobby   not even for a second    michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly strung wife and mother   a trend that started with   a thousand acres  and   one fine day     my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie   so much so that when she has a nervous break down   the veins on her temples bulge impressively    whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance   playing a lesbian cop   with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop    lastly   who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie   my grandmother comes to mind    
Pos, i know that   funnest   isn t a word       fun   is a noun   and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective    but that s the word that came to me right after viewing   chicken run      no wonder   this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions   like   that was the funnest movie i ve ever seen !    so to hell with webster s      chicken run   is one of the funnest movies i ve seen in a while    i can t remember the last time i ve seen anything funner    the chickens at tweedy s farm are up to something    living in a concentration camp like atmosphere   they are led by one plucky hen called ginger   voice of julia sawalha   who continually comes up with plans for escape    and always gets caught   subsequently spending day after day in the coal box    one night   a brash american rooster flies in over the fence   calling himself rocky   mel gibson     famous flying rooster and circus performer    rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly   and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs   tweedy   miranda richardson   decides to abandon the farm s egg selling plan for a pie selling plan    she orders a huge pie making machine   cackling     chickens go in   pies come out      what sort of pies    chicken pies   of course    co director nick park and his studio   aardman animation   produced three oscar winning short films     creature comforts       the wrong trousers     and   a close shave      the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit   a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures    part of what made the   wallace   films brilliantly entertaining was park s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new       the wrong trousers     for example   pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks   and   a close shave   owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories    but in the hands of park and his team   the stories felt fresh and inspired   and not the least bit contrived    now teaming with co director peter lord   park has created a similar creature in   chicken run      the plot is largely lifted from   the great escape     watch for a quick reference to the ball bouncing scene     with some spielberg inspired action sequences providing the excitement    thing is   the film doesn t feel like it s been lifted from somewhere else     chicken run   feels fresh   alive   like nothing else ever done    part of it is the original idea   who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners of war movie starring chickens    park and lord milk the incongruity for all it s worth   the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious   and to them   it is    but they re * chickens *   so it s funny to us    another thing that helps   chicken run     and most of park s films   succeed is the animators  subtle way of giving nods to the very films they re cribbing    there are references to   the great escape     obviously   and   stalag 17      the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both   raiders of the lost ark   and   indiana jones and the temple of doom      there s even a nod to   the blues brothers     if you can believe it   and the filmmakers even get in a little light hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor   taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson s nationality and film history    the   braveheart   reference is a hoot if you catch it    when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one     chicken run   is downright brilliant in its execution    consider this   since july of last year   i ve seen dozens upon dozens of   blair witch project   parodies   on television   on the radio   and online    out of all those   maybe one or two were amusing   the rest tiresome    why    because once you got past the thought that   they re parodying that&#8216   blair witch  movie     most of the parodies had nothing to offer    no insight   no original idea   no greater purpose    they were only funny if you had seen the movie   otherwise   you got nothing    conversely     chicken run   doesn t lean on its parodies    the film references are never the sole focus of any scene    if you ve never seen   indiana jones     the chase sequence is still fun    even if you have no idea who mel gibson is   rocky remains an interesting character    park   lord   and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it s understood   and as a result     chicken run   is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious   but not quite vague either    enjoyment of this movie doesn t require knowledge of film history   but if you ve got it     chicken run   is that much richer    the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances   and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it s hard not to fall in love with every one of them    ginger is perfect   spunky and opinionated   but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind   and julia sawalha   known as the cute mousy girl on   absolutely fabulous     nails it    she has warm   human chemistry with gibson   whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung ho veneer    the characters  inevitable romance doesn t feel contrived   but sweet    poor mr   tweedy   tony haygarth   suspects the chickens are organizing in some way   but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out   and his overbearing wife certainly isn t any help    jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs   a hen that runs away with most of the best one liners   all while perpetually crocheting a sweater     and two supply trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing dancing sequence    they even come up with an inspired riff on something that s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades   the chicken vs   egg dilemma    one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome   but as with most of   chicken run     it comes as a delightful surprise    the film manages to cross all barriers   it should be accessible to both children and adults   brits and yanks   rats and chickens    the animation is first rate    remember that this was all done the old fashioned way   with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit   and you see just how truly remarkable   chicken run   really is    this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios  animation great   precise and unwavering attention to detail    as in such top notch family fare as   a bug s life   or   toy story 2       chicken run   has something to offer in nearly every frame    certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes   but a active   attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they ll catch all the details    anyway   the movie s just a boatload of fun    funnest damn movie i ve seen all year    
Pos, capsule   a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg    joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs    it lets us see some new dinosaurs   is that an oxymoron     and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure    the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious    i had a good time       low +2    4 to +4    here goes my credibility    this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority    i liked the third jurassic park film    i even liked the second jurassic park film    in a lot of ways jurassic park   the lost world was a creative three way braiding together of michael crichton s novel the lost world   arthur conan doyle s novel the lost world   and the classic silent film version of the doyle    jp2 was an adventure   as doyle said     for the boy who s half man or the man who s half boy      that is what all the jurassic park films are    expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house    the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon s mines had under written characters also    jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs    the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be   and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting    some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds    that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require    i feel i got my money s worth    the story opens with eric   played by trevor morgan   and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica    this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park    they hope   no doubt   to get a look at the island s dinosaurs from a safe height    the height is safe   but driving the boat in the water is not    the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended    flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant   sam neill   in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide    he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs    but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go    doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple   william h   macy and tea leoni   who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs    they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn    he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once    right    guess what happens next    jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2    first it has alan grant and ellie sattler   laura dern   back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm    sattler has a much smaller part in jp3   but is still present to tie this story to the first    curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance    one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other   suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time    they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films    of course   these raptors look a little different also   so perhaps they are a different related species    not only are they more intelligent than in the past films   they are also more sympathetic    in this story they are not just killing machines   they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition    this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized    each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs   of course    in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus   not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus   but larger and presumably more nasty    it has a crocodile s head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright    perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs    sometimes they just move too fast to see    occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision    a few times we get unconvincing matte shot   particularly of the laboratory    but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films    the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams s score for the first film    joe johnston   who directs   already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky    a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay    the film they have made is a long way from great cinema   but it still is fun    if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today   the film is for you    i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the  4 to +4 scale    
Pos, just look back two years ago at the coen brothers  comedic gem the big lebowski   change the actors   take away the bowling alley   add a record store   and you ve got high fidelity   or maybe the other way around since nick hornby s novel high fidelity came first      either way   it s been done before   a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances   yet it remains consistently funny    why is this    maybe because you know your life is much better than this   you know these guys are more pathetic than you are   and you know its ok to laugh at them because they re fictional    director stephen frears   possibly not intentionally   has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day    when watching high fidelity   expect to laugh at someone else s pain   realize what you are laughing at   and then laugh again    i laughed at dick   todd louiso     the shy   timorous   steve buscemi character of lebowski   who seems to know what he is talking about but either can t put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends    i laughed at the john goodman character barry   jack black     an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons   pudgy   egotistic   and obnoxious at the same time    and i laughed at rob   john cusack     the jeff bridges type   whom the story revolves around    rob is the character easiest to relate to   but he is nothing like you at all    he uncontrollably cheats and lies   then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman    and like his other miserable friends   pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort    he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it    whatever human emotions the clash   aretha franklin   and bruce springsteen records hold   rob and co    grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives    rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in    during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on   rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him    but these aren t any girlfriends   these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob   rob s incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life      the plot in three words is   women and music    the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective    it gives high fidelity a quickly paced   informal structure   adjectives which perfectly parallel rob s own lifestyle    it also helps open the viewer s eyes as to how annoying barry is    jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball    just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob   who must work with him every day of the week    what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes    john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast   consisting of big stars and character actors   that really defines rob    now instead of rob just talking to the camera   after he explains something   the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say    the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn t end when it should have ended    instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that    also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie    high fidelity is a cheerful   old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs    i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen   they make everyone look and feel great    
Pos, plot   a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes    he is taken prisoner along with some other humans   and tries his best to escape his simian captors    oh yeah   and did i mention that the apes can talk    kewl !  critique   despite this film not looking like a   tim burton movie   or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself   i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun   summer fare    although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make up jobs and characterizations    i mean   i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real !  i also have to   give it up   to all of the actors inside the costumes   not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make up slobbered all over them for 2 4 hours   but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well    i especially enjoyed bonham carter s performance   who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film   human or ape   and tim roth s bad guy   who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part    plot wise   i liked the beginning of the film   the whole build up once wahlberg got into the village   the escape and most of the fight scenes   but once things got out into the deserted area   and the final battle sequence     i kinda lost a bit of my interest    i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of   human beings as animals   then i was about the end battle sequence   which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film    i also hated the   kid   character who just got on my nerves and didn t really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved   i won t ruin it here but c mon guys       you  coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that   no        but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character   his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter species love interests    this dude didn t seem to give a rat s ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn t really care about what happened to him either    now i m not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script   but the film suffered because of it    visually   the movie was also nice to look at   especially the apes !     but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton    the   surprise ending   that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968   felt a little tacked on here   and despite being interesting   didn t really make all that much sense to me   unless you look at it from a sequel point of view      so overall   i loved the whole   feel   of the planet   the apes that ruled it   the manner in which they treated the humans   screamed   shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain   but didn t appreciate the film s lack of human character development   why was kris kristofferson even in this movie     and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring    but i would still recommend this film as a fun   summer movie with laughs   creepiness and a really cool premise    ps   for anyone who has seen the original   i cannot believe that they didn t at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character   in this case   mark wahlberg   goes nuts at the world in which he s suddenly been thrust     this is a mad house !      type of thing      the guy in this film barely seems to be   put off   by the fact that he s surrounded by apes who can speak english ! !  where s joblo coming from    the arrival   8/10     battlefield earth   7/10     godzilla   4/10     instinct   6/10     mission to mars   3/10     pitch black   7/10       1968   planet of the apes   9/10     sleepy hollow   8/10    
Pos, disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched    to see a disaster film with actual originality   or at least a decent plot twist   would definitely be a welcome surprise    unfortunately   folks   it s not likely    dante s peak is cliched   and at times corny   but also pretty decent    to be honest   i wasn t very interested in seeing this film   and word of mouth   as well as several reviews   didn t make it sound promising    so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn t bad at all    it s pretty run of the mill   but it s not something i would say is merely   ok   to watch    in case you don t know   dante s peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it s shadow   dante s peak   who would ve guessed   eh        pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and   perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof   is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future    due to the lack of more substantial evidence   nobody warns the small town   and when they finally do   it s in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows    brosnan   all around good guy   will   of course   save the day            or at least the mayor of dante s peak   linda hamilton      naturally the two will become infatuated with one another       if you think i just ruined a plot development   you haven t seen very many movies !    there s also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings    and of course   the kids or the dog   at least one or the other   will do something heroic            but hey   i don t want to ruin all the surprises !  if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante s peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time   i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself    it s not brain food   but it succeeds at what it s meant to be            an enjoyable   suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash !  
Pos, in brief   best bleak comedy film since heathers    full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture    go see it !  so   i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on   hard copy   with pam smart   the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980 s       hard copy    s diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman s fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for    smart replied that she thought kidman s character came off as a dumb   vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal       smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband      smart s got a point    it wouldn t be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version    however   given a choice between the mass media  happening  of the real event and the fictionalized movie   i would definitely opt for the later    real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart   while pretty and alluring   is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman    to die for begins in a town called little hope   new hampshire   the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb    the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being  on tv      of course   one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry   played by matt dillon    but   with a little imagination   some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement   our heroine manages to overcome the nay sayers in her life   at least temporarily    kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne    i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture    her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates    kidman knows a star making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven   post feminist uber temptress from hell    she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue   which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way    at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister in law       you know     she knowingly exclaims     gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever   if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head      her husband beams at suzanne s profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters    this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven   folks    the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix    he plays jimmy   a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne s sexual favors    kidman s character   vapid though she is   is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia   winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland    phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen x slackerhood   as envisioned by tabloid tv   of course      his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain t going anywhere   ever    phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne   someone who actually noticed him    gus van sant   drugstore cowboy   my own private idaho   direction is first rate    he keeps the pacing in this not quite thriller snapping along    van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn t stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions    van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to  get it  without stopping to explain what is funny about this all american story    the screenplay   by buck henry   is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i ve heard since heathers    henry s story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame   yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters    henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini classic    danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric   loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands    either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick or treat parties    all in all   a wonderful production   well worth your seven bucks !  to die for   a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant    written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman   matt dillon   joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard    rated r   for language and mature themes       respect the r   not for under 14 s   rating       stars    go see it    
Pos, i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool    i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage   grousing to myself about its transparently planes   trains and automobiles plot machinations   and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement    this was a mass market romantic comedy   after all   a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and   even in its best days   worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm    then marc lawrence did something wonderful   something which made the entire film click into place   he showed me a comic love story about grown ups    it certainly didn t look that way from the outset   which introduces groom to be ben holmes   ben affleck   at his bachelor party   surrounded by friends and family whooping over his   last night of freedom      ben loves his fiancee bridget   maura tierney     but the doom and gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this  till death do you part business    then   on an ill fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah   ben meets sarah lewis   sandra bullock     a free spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her    as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn   ben and sarah begin a three day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger   ben seeing in sarah the chances he s never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she s never had    forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start   setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue    ben is an ideal role for affleck s easy going charm   and he plays the straight laced straight man without forced exasperation    sandra bullock   for her part   is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half dozen films combined   avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping    the two performances    part of a great top to bottom cast    are effective and connected from the start   yet the script s apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely    lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis   forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self justification    the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose   leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution    forces of nature isn t about a man developing a fear of commitment   it s about a man learning what commitment means  to him    learning that it s not what he thought it was    lawrence s script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending   an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense    earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance   and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine    though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film   and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples   forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you ll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom    that is   provided you re not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes    for a brisk romantic comedy   forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over directed scenes of the year   teetering hand held shots   why not low or high angles   sweeping pans    occasionally the hyper real approach works   with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance   far more often   hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is   covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can t find what s underneath    a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director   but even hughes  excesses can t spoil this unique concoction    forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant   something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents    
Pos, warning   this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film   fail safe      if you haven t seen the film yet   proceed with caution    nutshell   a relevant   intelligent   suspenseful drama    still powerful today   even after the end of the cold war                           fail safe     usa   1964   drama   111 minutes  screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e   youngstein directed by sidney lumet  review by jamahl epsicokhan                       the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn t have a winning side and a losing side    in a nuclear confrontation   everybody loses   and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world  assuming the world survives    the idea  and perhaps the only real option  is to avoid war at all costs    this is the theme of sidney lumet s   fail safe     a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler       fail safe   takes place during the heart of the cold war   the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis     when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word   communism    the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws    five u   s   bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america    the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner   but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers    suddenly out of contact   and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives   the bomber pilots cannot be recalled   and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike    a great deal of   fail safe    s plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u   s   bombers from reaching russia s borders  at any cost    the plot is compelling   and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios    the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails    general bogan   frank overton     taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself   henry fonda     is powerless  the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated   pre programmed system that may not be stoppable   simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no win situation winnable    the events in   fail safe   are fascinating because they re anything but predictable   but the real reason   fail safe   works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot    a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war   communism   the cold war   and the united states  role in all of it    most of this is through the film s use of the character groeteschele   walter matthau     an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who   incidentally   is on the president s advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war    many of the film s most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices    early in the film   he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of   strategy   in a nuclear assault to   minimize   casualties       what s the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead      a guest asks impatiently       forty million     groeteschele responds wryly    the problem with groeteschele s mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war    the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals    groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over    yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off   as general black   dan o herlihy   has often recommended    on the contrary  according to groeteschele   that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u   s     which would clearly put america at a disadvantage    such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race       fail safe   clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war   and   likewise   it becomes a central theme in the film    why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over    is it wise    is it even logical    no   not really    although   fail safe   is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism   there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial   one sided sort of way    again   this is achieved through groeteschele   who is easily the film s most important character in terms of the larger theme significance    in addition to providing the central   pro nuclear war   voice that the film warns against   he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism    the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib    one of groeteschele s   logical   trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it s merely absurd    he labels the average marxist an   unfeeling   calculating machine   that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself    groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u   s   drops the warhead on moscow   the soviets will * instantly * surrender   for to retaliate would invite counter measures that would further destroy russia s home soil  which must be preserved at all costs    groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions   general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge  as any normal person would    the irony here is groeteschele s own mechanical theorizing    he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn t even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns    once the film makes it evident that turning the u   s   bombers will be impossible   the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be    just how will the soviet union s leader react   and what can the president do to convey his best intentions       just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap *      with the help of his translator buck   larry hagman     the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader   in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity   with lumet s long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame   exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader    without getting into too much detail   i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly   yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances       that is   as sensible as a nuclear   incident   can probably be      it does accomplish what it must   it avoids an all out war   something that simply isn t possible because of its all too real consequences    dramatically   the ending is quite powerful   and the use of o herlihy s character as the symbolic   matador     providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film s opening     is particularly appropriate       fail safe   is a production of a major hollywood studio   released by columbia pictures     and it has the structure of a high tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film    nevertheless   under lumet s direction and walter bernstein s intelligent adaptation of burdick s and wheeler s novel   the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded    the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming    but it was the conscious   human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that   fail safe   also finds dangerous    in retrospect   the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century    it s just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down   rather than continuing groeteschele s dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown    
Pos, andrew lloyd webber s musicals   preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice   present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time    webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as   oklahoma !     or the slapstickness of shows like   a funny thing happened on the way to the forum      they instead tackle hot issues from our past   and view them differently   and pack them together with redundant   catchy music   as well as thoughtful lyrics    like   jesus christ superstar     which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective   in the cool tune   superstar     a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn t spread his message wider       evita   takes an inventive stance on its topic   this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator   juan per   n   eva   who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention   much like the woman playing her   madonna   although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent   among other things         evita   deals with the rise and fall of eva per   n   a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan   jonathan pryce     then died at the young age of 33   creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di   the two do share a bit in common   although it wasn t like di slept to   the top        webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals   but they always have a point for doing it    here   they wish to expose her for what she is   but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks   her lying   and covering up for her fascist husband   but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions   and her death was very sad    it s also a musical   with almost no words not unsung    the film plays like a rock opera   much like their   jesus christ superstar     with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals   even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics   which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience   but also a very entertaining one    after all   this is a musical   and webber s musicals never undermine this    they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth   walking on a fine line between the both   and never stumbling on either side    this is why the beginning of   evita   is kind of a let down    okay   it is a let down    i m not saying the opening moments are bad   because they re pretty good    but what comes after is a lifeless   un entertaining   and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer   jimmy nail   into taking eva to buenos aires after a one night stand    in the musical   it s a fun   energetic sequence   culiminating in the show stopper     buenos aires     which is also lifeless    then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer   instead of her leaving him   where she ends up singing the sad tune     another suitcase in another hall     which was meant for a later character   screwed over by eva    the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft   seeming like parker and oliver stone   who adapted it for the screen   are afraid to present her for what she is   even while it s being narrated by a hater of eva s   the omnipotent   antonio banderas     who presents her in a negative light    for a while   it looks like alan parker can t pull it off    however   the film pulls itself together in a flash   and after that song is over   and the giddily nihilistic song   goodbye and thank you     where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend   is magnificent   darkly comical   and just gleeful    from this point on   the film is hypnotic   satisfying   and satirical    no more punches are thrown   and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact    we see eva woo and marry juan   get him out of jail   rise to stardom   falter a bit   come back   and then gradually die of cancer   i think it was because of cancer      more importantly   many of the themes from the musical carry on with this   as well as some filling in the gaps reconnassaince work    juan   who is pretty underwritten in the musical   is given some extra scenes   and exposed as what he was for eva   an accessory    a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan   and understand his sadness more than we did before    >from the   goodbye and thank you   number on   the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation   and saved a government   even while it left the nation s people downtrodden    but despite this   the nation still loved eva   and when she slipped into death   the world mourned her because she was a star    that s when our narrator   ch     comes out to show that she wasn t the great woman she really was   and expose her fame    describing this character is difficult   mainly because he has no real realistic background   he s said to be based on the revolutionary ch   guevera   but the two probably could have never met   like they do in the film     but he serves as a perspective on eva   but even his perspective can t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death    alan parker   no stranger to bizarre musicals   he s done   fame       the committments       bugsy malone     and   pink floyd the wall     the latter which is absolutely brilliant     nails the film   exposing everything for what it is    we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should   by the way it is presented    his direction is manipulative for a reason   to show the mourning for what it is    and there is energy throughout   with lots of bright colors   and scenes which are cinematically entertaning   as well as enriching and deep   such as the balcony scene where she sings   don t cry for me   argentina     and her death sequence   which is poignant becuase of how sad it is    madonna s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie   starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly   remaning there for the rest of the film    at the beginning   she looks like she s too busy concentrating on her singing to act   but she eventually gets it right   though never really getting the presence of   say   patti lupone   who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s      her death   though   is brilliant    her singing could be better though    i know she took lessons to improve her range and all   but it still sounds like she s trying to hard    she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding   like       patti  lupone   i heard her sing on an old   evita   cd   and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her      but it s generally very good   although not up to the brilliance the role really requires    antonio banderas   who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days   i m one of the few people who thinks he rocks     is extremely comanding in his performance   presenting a lovable narrator    his singing is very good   though nothing compared to the original   mandy patinkin    he does have a pretty good singing voice   and a great range    and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome   although very brief at times   in his role as juan   seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade    although it gets off to a rocky start     rocky    s polite for what it really is     it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical    like the other musical released in  96   woody allen s   everyone says i love you       it s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead   but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance    
Pos, there s more to a quilt than fabric and thread  each patchwork design has its own unique story   or stories   to tell    in how to make an american quilt   the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse   proof     we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality    all the sorrows   joys   longings   sufferings   and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and   as their bittersweet memories are given expression   one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future    motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals   how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative    the   quilting bee   consists of seven members   sisters gladys   ann bancroft   and hy   ellen burstyn     sophia   lois smith     a woman known for frightening children   emma   jean simmons     the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man   constance   kate nelligan     who has been having an affair with emma s husband   anna   maya angelou     the leader of the group   and marianna   alfre woodard     anna s daughter    the project they re busy with is the wedding quilt for hy s granddaughter   finn   winona ryder     who has just become engaged    she s spending the summer with hy and gladys   and away from her fiance   to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants   and whether it s better to marry a friend or a lover    one of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast    from winona ryder   ann bancroft   ellen burstyn   and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn   claire danes   and kate capshaw   this film is overflowing with realized talent    the performances are good enough   in fact   to cover up many of the script s weaknesses    how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable   if affecting   tale of love across the generations  a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club   with a dash of fried green tomatoes added    there are probably too many characters    so   instead of really getting to know a few of them   we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives    we learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy   and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible    there are other episodes as well   the love of anna s life   marianna s soul mate   and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend s husband    the sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn s story   whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger    there is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt    the stories are all well told   but it s difficult to really connect with the characters  their moments pass so quickly    while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals   our emotional investment is tenuous    there isn t enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way   and many of the personalities and relationships feel half  formed   like a quilt with patches missing    to put it bluntly   while i enjoyed watching this film   it didn t   do much   for me    on the whole   how to make an american quilt is a nicely understated drama that has a lot to say about love   passion   and monogamy in relationships    finn s segment is by far the most compelling   because she s the focal point   her actions are shaped by everyone else s experiences    the other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees    if there s a disappointment here   it s that the script doesn t have more resonance   but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional    
Pos, mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv show er    her mast famous episode     love s labour lost     dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child    the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing    there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood s big blockbuster movies    so it s only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster    and i have to say   after a shaky beginning   she does not disappoint    peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists   which is obviously nothing new    the first half hour goes into detail   way too much detail   about how the weapons are stolen    despite a few good images   including a train collision and a very impressive explosion   none of this was very coherent    it s long and drawn out   and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better    once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture   it begins to take off    george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world    he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters    nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling    there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two   but that is dispensed with quickly    the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe   trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them   clooney  goes through bouts of sarcasm   frustration   determination   and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self doubt    this is when leder starts to show her true stuff    she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer    then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter    then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york city s crowded streets   and a madman with a nuke walking among them    mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense    she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking    nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero    you re not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her    george clooney is a real movie star    many of you may have hated him as batman   but this guy is for real    he has a natural screen presence   and an ingratiating personality    he ll be around for a while    dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker    
Pos, i have to say it    tim burton s retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys    ok   that s off my chest    no more monkey puns   i promise    seriously   though   planet of the apes is one rip roarin  summer outing   filled with thrills   action   adventure   wit and bits of funny   dare i say   monkey   business    i know   i know   i promised    and for those film buffs who are fond of the original   burton s version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie    mark wahlberg stars as capt   leo davidson   a deep space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future    he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted   captured and sold into slavery    despite being darker than the original   burton s film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious    some of the movie s flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton   an organ grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed    then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter    the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty     one thing you don t want in your house is a human teen ager     he says    you don t have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement    touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton s brand    lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout   the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian s foot to try righting himself are     take your stinking hand off of me   you damned   dirty human      anyone familiar with the first version of the film will   of course   recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue    another of burton s in jokes is to have charlton heston   star of the original   play the chimpanzee father of tim roth s gen   thade    the young chimp goes to visit his dying father    both have one thing in common   a hatred of humans    with his dying breath   the elder spews out his vile     damn them   damn them all to hell     he says before expiring    that is the famous line heston s taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet s terrible secret    the performances throughout are top notch    wahlberg plays davidson not as some gung ho hero   but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home    he is reluctant to lead the human rebellion   his only objective being to find a way off this upside down planet    this hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable    roth is ferocious   cunning   cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity    he leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet    it is a masterful turn    helena bonham carter is ari   the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals    hers is a smart   compassionate characterization    michael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken    a fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo   the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures    as the battle between apes and humans looms   the cowardly limbo pleads     can t we all just get along     echoing the words of rodney king    much of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton s technical crew   especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup    burton s musical collaborator   danny elfman   provides another fine score   though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow    the movie s only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original    he comes close   but falls short    otherwise   planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be   an amusement park ride filled with lots of action   stunts and a few laughs    this is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre release hype    
Pos, urban legend surprised me    based on the last few films the genre has produced   including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer   disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween   h20     i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena    thankfully   legend rose above it s soggy premise to become not only a hip   scary and stylish entertainment   but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year    you re all familiar with the plot   a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who s identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be   you guessed it   everybody s favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks       the  only person you didn t suspect !  however   just because legend doesn t really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can t qualify as first class entertainment    it was   believe it or not   one of the funnest times i ve had at the movies all year    the thing is   i m not really sure what made this particular stab   pardon the pun   at the genre seem so fresh and alive    maybe it was the above par performances by the movie s two leads   jared leto and   cybil   actress alicia witt      or   it could have been the on  target direction by jamie blanks    more likely   though   it was because of the inspired premise    i don t think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman    urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener   not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film    a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when   gasp !   a gas problem   hee hee   forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill    one problem   though    would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif    i thought not    predictably   the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company    it s odd   though   when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody s on the other line    naturally   the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off    and the when we least expect it       whack ! ! !  a decapitation    it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car    so who is it this time    the obvious candidate is the slightly off kilter professor at the college the girl went to   none other than freddy kruger himself   robert englund     who teaches a class on urban legends    a ha    or could it be the fame hungry local journalist   leto   looking for a meaty story to put on his resume    like all movies of this nature   one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit    and it turns out to be   of course   the one you didn t suspect    i m not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is   but i must give credit where credit is due    and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been       fun     * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi   ca  
Pos, capsule   the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi day festivities    mira nair s film is pleasant enough with a little human drama   a few family secrets   some sadness and some happiness    you have seen it all before   but perhaps not from india    the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable       low +2    4 to +4    mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala    her newest film   written by sabrina dhawan   is very similar to previous films like betsy s wedding but it is set in new delhi    a wealthy family is having a wedding    an indian wedding is a multi day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial    even more than in the us   it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get together    the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members  individual story lines    aditi verma is marrying hemant   an indian engineer working in the us    she had previously had a relationship with vikram   her supervisor    latit   her father   played by naseeruddin shah     is juggling many problems   not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey    dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration    even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice   one of the family servants    several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex   family secrets   or both    there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love    some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films    western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna    on the other hand it was not clear   to me at least   if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films    this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english    the latter will   however   help with an international release    sabrina dhawan s screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog    we have seen films with plotting very much like this   but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference    director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life    i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the  4 to +4 scale    
Pos, the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man s life   especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances    thematically in cinema   love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters   it is rare   however   for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni s neo classic drama   life is beautiful    through a central cast of father   mother   and son   benigni demonstrates the wonderful   undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times    life * is * beautiful for guido orefice   roberto benigni   directing himself here for the sixth time in his career     an italian jew   master con man   and aspiring waiter extraordinaire    living in 1930 s italy   he lives a carefree life of good fortune   it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora   nicoletta braschi      although dora is already engaged   guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead   the two have a child named joshua   giorgio cantarini      unfortunately for the happy family   the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps    it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie s theme of family love becomes the strongest    although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm   he relaxes the role to ensure his son s happiness    now   instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora   he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right    benigni s performance is truly a well rounded one   and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year    the supports are all strong as well   but the movie truly excels in its script    life is beautiful is a self proclaimed fable   one which tells its story in grand   two part fashion    in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a   saturday night live   spinoff    a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot    but in the movie s second half the script s circular nature becomes admirably obvious    characters make reprise appearances in fine form   and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot s outcome    in all   fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture   and novice movie watchers may take this opportunity to see their first   artsy   film    life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone   and above all is a fine thematic picture    
Pos, while watching wes anderson s rushmore   it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer   the film s anti hero   was not written with jason schwartzman in mind    the young actor   making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman    schwartzman plays max   a student who is more interested in his extra curricular activities   such as writing edgy plays like   serpico   and being president of the rushmore beekeepers   but sees his grades suffer as a result    on the brink of being thrown out   he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross   olivia williams   and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume   the great bill murray   to build an aquarium   on rushmore s baseball field   in her honour    unfortunately for everyone involved   blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well   which gets in the way of max s plans to woo her    max is one of the best written characters we ve yet seen in the 90s   and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age    as everyone else has probably already pointed out   he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman   although i was reminded more of paul from   the wonder years     from a visual standpoint   at least      hopefully   if he avoids typecasting as weird   quirky loner types he should earn himself a good career    bill murray is his equal as blume   displaying a depth we haven t yet seen from him    while this isn t his best performance   that honour goes to groundhog day   he is still terrific here    williams isn t given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray   but still does fine work    rushmore seems to go just a little too long but   while it isn t a perfect film   it is a definate must see for anyone who wants to see that rarity   an american coming of age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality    anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should   with any luck   rise to even greater success    
Pos, no   i did not read the novel by thomas hardy     jude the obscure     his final novel   final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again   see   i did do some research on it   about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life    but   after watching the movie   i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is       jude   is a satirical film from start to finish about society s way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system   but what s remarkable is how timeless this film is    the film takes place in the late 19th century   or early 20th   wasn t really sure     but its story could even be retold today in modern form   although it d be kinda different   a given      it tells the story of jude   christopher eccleston   the psychotic accountant from   shallow grave       a simple   dim witted young man with big dreams    in its bleak   foreboding opening   shot in grainy black and white   he gets a lesson from phillotson   liam cunningham     his teacher   as they stand upon a mountain   looking upon a city in the distance   he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world    after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella   rachel griffiths   because they frolicked in the hay   literally   but did not ultimately share anything in common   he moves away to a town with a giant university   with a chance to learn more   and get ahead in life    taking a welding job   he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars   reciting latin over and over again   and training himself    but when he sends his application for the school in   he is bluntly told to just remain a worker    another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there   sue   kate winslet     his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher    she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends   so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job   for none other than phillotson at the local school     there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business   nudge nudge      several twists turn in the storyline   and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business   an interesting scene   to say the least           and are soon born into a controversial non wedlock   as she eventually gives birth to their baby   and jude inherits his son from arabella   who turns up again after awhile    because they aren t married   and because they re cousins   they run into problems with every place they go to   carrying around two children everywhere   and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time   then moving on    if you didn t think this was harsh enough   wait till you see what happens later on        the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world    he will never gain any true happiness   and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting   and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life    part of it is his fault   he s too optimistic   and too gullible    but society has a way of taking these people   and hurting them until their death    the ending of   jude   is bleak because it has to be   although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse   guess i ll have to read it now         jude   offers a satirical view on society s cruelties   but shows no way of curing this   and thank heavens it doesn t    there s no way to relinquish the selfishness of society   and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem    satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people s minds   and that s what   jude   is    sure   it s one hell of a downer   but it needs to be    the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads   and some good supporting work along with it    christopher eccleston   slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression   plays jude wonderfully   sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face   and making him kind of child like at other times    kate winslet   in a pre    titanic   performance   is brilliant   nailing every psyche of her character   and creating someone who s troubled but very seductive with her personality    kate may be the best actress in her age group   if you don t believe me   see   titanic     branagh s   hamlet       sense and sensibility     and   heavenly creatures     the latter one being my favorite performance of hers      in the supporting roles   liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher   exposing all his bad parts   but ultimately being a pretty good person   and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude s wife   whom he never divorces       jude   moves at a very slow pace   and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists   which would drive some people nuts    but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films   no matter how slow or downright depressing they are   this one is both   will appreciate   jude     though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it    
Pos, quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie    he runs into the last dragon in existence   and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth   but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain    eventually   they decide to call a truce   and they work out a deal    since he is the last dragon   he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it    their scam works at first   until they come to a town without any money    instead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon   but of course   draco is a nice droagon   so he won t eat her   there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl    of course   as you can probably tell by the plot   this is a silly movie   but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times   unlike eddie   which was serious all the time    you could probably call this a medieval comedy   because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined    dennis quaid makes a fine hero    pete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them    dina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl    but lets face it   the movie is really about the dragon   and what an amazing creation he is    connery s voice and ilm team up to provide us with a truly magnificent dragon    so   if you are going to see this movie for a strong hard core medieval epic   you are going to the wrong movie    if you are going because of the dragon   you will not be dissapointed   and you will be provided with plenty of laughs that smooth out the boring parts in the script    
Pos, it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters    his new film   the thin red line   is a strange   beautiful   enigmatic mess of a movie    the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast    it is filled with above the title stars    the cast   for the most part   gives great performances    john travolta   whose role is nothing more than a cameo   seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve    george clooney   whose role became a cameo in editing   gives a strange performance    one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character s narration    the rest of the cast   especially nick nolte and elias koteas   are unambiguously fantastic    these actors   and they are   with two exceptions   men   were lured by the name of malick    terrence malick is a cinematic legend    he has often been called   the j   d   salinger of cinema      his two previous films   badlands and days of heaven   are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures    after he made them   he disappeared for 20 years    this film marks his return    what he s made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment    the narration which fills the film   and perplexes many   not only lets us hear the narrators   the characters themselves   pontificate   but also lets us hear such of the moment thoughts as   i m scared      the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted    the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill    a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult   because the story is fractured    many stories are here   from the clash between the lieutenant   elias koteas   and the savage colonel   a voracious nick nolte   to the private   ben chaplin   who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going    the fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault    it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box   shook the box   and poured the results onto a table    this basically creates a mess   but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed    i m not declaring that the film has no structure    while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot   malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat    the battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking    the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice    this film uses color and light in such a fantastic way   that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video    ultimately   malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them    the film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature    while some have said that the anti war message and pro nature tubthumping was juvenile   it was done with so much complexity and thought   that it cannot ever honestly be called childish    after seeing the thin red line   i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again    
Pos,    stuart little   is one of the best family films to come out this year    it s a cute   funny and very good natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords    though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about   i do know that this film does not disappoint    finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be   with a few surprising twists   some very funny moments   and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie    stuart little is a mouse    he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption   he now lives with the littles    a nice little   no pun intended   family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city    they have a little boy george   played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki   and now they have a new son    at first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat    george doesn t take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first   but once the two play together they instantly bond    stuart however is missing something   and he wants to know who his real parents are    the littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back    hesitating the littles know what s best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat   he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart s past ending up to a sentimental and very heart warming ending    one thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects    just like in   star wars   episode 1  the phantom menace   stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real    from the detail of their fur   to the detail of the way the walk   the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this $90 million dollar film and it shows    another movie that this has in common with is   babe   with it s talking animals and people understanding them    it has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids    michael j   fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the   homeward bound   movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could    he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable    another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball    when he was timon in 1994 s   the lion king   i would have sworn he was a comedian   and now in   stuart little   he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike    for the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well    she fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr   little    both make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996 s   jerry maguire      even though stuart little is completely cgi   the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other       stuart little   is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter    we get entertainment   laughs   cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie    its nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see    even though it has a $90 million dollar budget i m sure it will make over that or just below it respectively    for all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie   i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know   stuart little   and   toy story 2   are by far the best family films this year    a winner      
Pos, as with his other stateside releases   jackie chan s latest chopsocky vehicle   mr   nice guy   is contrived   blockheaded   and lacking in narrative logic    but also like those other films   it is a highly enjoyable ride    once again   chan s screenwriters   here edward tang and fibe ma   have taken the easy way out and named their star s character simply jackie   with no last name    this jackie is a world class chef who co hosts a popular cooking show on australian television    of course   jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist   and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter s   gabrielle fitzpatrick   expose of a drug dealing ring    other plot details   involving a videotape and a biker gang   are irrelevant   in fact   as is the case with most chan films   the plot itself is just about irrelevant    the sole purpose of mr   nice guy s existence are chan s comic fight scenes   and those here do not disappoint    director samo hung   who has a cameo role     a longtime collaborator of chan s   does not waste any time putting chan in action   diving head on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue    other impressive set pieces follow   most notably a chase in a mall   which directly leads to some frenzied   if cliched   can you say fruit cart       business involving a runaway carriage   and an extended late film sequence at a construction site   in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards   cement mixers   and a deadly buzzsaw    none of the action sequences in mr   nice guy are as spectacular as supercop s thrilling helicopter train finale or rumble in the bronx s daring leap between two buildings   nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor   respectively    but the action delivers   even if the energy peters out before the film s end   the finale   as spectacular as it is   is a letdown for fans of chan s athletic prowess      filmed almost entirely in english   even so   the voices of some english speaking actors are laughably dubbed     mr   nice guy hints at jackie chan s latest transition to hollywood productions   he made ill fated attempts with 1980 s the big brawl and 1985 s the protector     next in the pipeline is rush hour   a stateside production co starring chris tucker    hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown   and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr   nice guy   for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands   much like they have been before    
Pos, the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it s adequately explained by the commercials    with 11 days to go until the election   the president   who we never see   calls in political dirty tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal    deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a   pageant     a phony war against albania   fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville   with woody harrelson as the reluctant   psychotic hero    and if there wasn t anything more to the movie than this   it would be a second rate heist comedy at best   enlivened by great actors    like sneakers goes to washington       a heist comedy    yup    deniro and hoffman are   stealing   the election   so to speak   and the movie is more about how they do it    and the fun they have doing it    than anything else      wag the dog succeeds because it s based one great truth   the american people are stupid    ok   maybe it s not   love thy neighbor as thyself   or even   two plus two makes four     but a truth nonetheless       any average person who thinks that they re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes    moviemaking and the political process    is invited   nay   challenged   to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c span when the house is in session      and because we re so utterly   predictably stupid   hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo   washington knows that we won t notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies    and deniro s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won t be able to locate albania on the map    the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn t a light   meaningless comedy about politics   like speechless   the michael keaton   geena davis picture   or from the level of light hearted politcal satire to near greatness    nor is it a hard edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally deprived   ethically challenged baby boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house   like primary colors    and yes   i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out   thanks for asking      instead   david mamet s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire    it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers  schemes come off beautifully   and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion    deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables   without any of the violent rages    it s all     what do i love    what is it that brings me joy    baseball     minus the savage bloody beating with the bat    he threatens a lot of people   mind you   but he s doing it in a very nice   polite way    it s a very mellow   restrained performance   which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script    hoffman   on the other hand   is giddy   exuberant and joyous    this kind of thing is what his character lives for   and he s so excited that he can t even shut up    even on the edge of disaster   he s bright eyed   behind oddly tinted sunglasses   and positive    insiders note that he s basing his character on some powerful but anonymous producer    which may or may not be true   but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets put on a show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have    the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast    the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them   listen to them talk in that wised up mamet dialogue   get to know them better    which we don t    anne heche   is dead bang on in her portrayal of a political press aide    cool and composed on the outside   panicked and frenzied on the outside    denis leary   one of my favorite actors    see the ref   is the   fad king     who handles the profitable   back end      t shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative   innovative ways to separate a fool from his money    they could make a whole movie   just about the fad king   and i d go see it    willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously   from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song   to the weepy country waltz   to the hilarious   ballad of the green berets   parody    woody harrelson has a brief   but memorable part as the overmedicated   hero   of the albanian conflict    craig t   nelson   as the opposition candidate   and the ever reliable william h   macy   as a wacky cia agent   are given surprisingly short shrift       one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing      wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems   the trivialization of american politics   the role of the press in dumbing down the issues   the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials   the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars    the list goes on    we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens    wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don t    
Pos, as the film opens up   expectant unwed mother sally   played by drew barrymore   encounters her baby s father in a fast food drive through window    after he gets his milkshake   he drives off   only to be pursued by a military helicopter    from this moment forward   you know that this isn t going to be your run of the mill romantic comedy    home fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian   played by luke wilson     a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally       more  than he would care to admit   hint   it has something to do with the father of sally s unborn child      after taking a personal   and professional   interest in her   he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works   and the fun goes on from there    this movie is a lot of fun    it is comedic on two levels   as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy    the romantic moments are sweet   yet not sappy    one of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes    however   the dark comedic moments are more memorable    this is also a tale of revenge   and a funny one at that    the father of sally s unborn child also happened to be a married man   whose wife is played by catherine o hara    she does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair   and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work       my apologies if this sounds cryptic   but there is too much of the plot to give away      rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus   dorian s overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy   dorian s trainer at the fast food restaurant    the dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones   even with the romantic nature of the plot    if there are any complaints   it is over drew barrymore s performance    while she does light up the screen   there are moments when she doesn t seem all that convincing    the movie was filmed in texas   and most of the characters have southern texan accents    drew barrymore s accent tends to come and go   luke wilson doesn t seem to have this problem      as well   she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant    still   this movie is one that will please many viewers    with plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments   this is sure to entertain    
Pos, the second jackal based film to come out in 1997   the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal     this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland   and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo s own alma matter   concordia university in montreal   canada    the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal   but does not pretend to be 100% factual    plot   naval officer ramirez   quinn   gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal   in order to put an end to the actual militant s radical activities    he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee    ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this   assignment     and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism   intrigue and double personality syndrome   which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states      critique   great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two hour runtime    admittedly   i wasn t a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film   and didn t expect much from this movie beforehand   but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments   as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line    the first hour is mostly just a build up of things to come   and does offer a great characterization of the jackal   but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending    quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal   but didn t offer anything extraordinary   in my opinion    sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they ve played in both of their respective careers of late   but nonetheless   appeared to relish the cold heartedness of their chosen characters    i didn t like performance put forth from quinn s wife in this flick   but then again   she doesn t show up in most of the film   so that wasn t so bad    i did however enjoy director duguay s interesting style and cinematic vision    this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences   but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer    i thought that was neat    having said that   i didn t think the first hour needed to be as long as it was   and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the   fake   jackal met with the   real   jackal s girlfriend without much retrospection on her part   but all in all   not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre    little known facts   ben kingsley s real name is krishna banji   he stands 5   8   was born in scarborough   england   and won the best actor honor in 1982 s academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi    many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal   canada   joblo s haven of restfulness      donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland   is canadian   and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal    
Pos, one of the last entries in the long running carry on series   carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a  caravan  site    professors anna vrooshka   elke sommer   and roland crump   kenneth williams   and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep   kenneth connor   so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains    anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick     for instance   when anna is asking for  scrubbers for dirty caravan    she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan !  arthur upmore   bernard bresslaw   and his wife linda   patsy rowlands   take her mother daphne barnes   joan sims   and her minah bird on holiday with them    mother in law jokes prevail    furthermore   the trouble that joe and norma baxter   ian lavender and adrienne posta   have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families    fred ramsden   windsor davies   and ernie bragg   jack douglas   leave their wives   liz fraser and patricia franklin   behind for a fishing holiday    however   they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls   sandra   carol hawkins   and carol   sherrie hewson      the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day to day running of the camp   the search for the minah bid and greyhound   the major   fred and ernie s desperate need of a woman   a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park s pub   and a shock in store for daphne    the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing    this is what binds the movie together    joan sims stands out as the demanding mother in law   bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife   and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast    on the other hand   there are low key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman   and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen !  even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman   there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors    although the regular cast is depleted   the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film    a relative flop at the cinema   this movie deserves a lot more recognition    
Pos, the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now     it mu5t be found      so what   exactly   is the fifth element    after seeing luc besson s ambitious   much shrouded in secrecy science fiction fantasy   i could not help but be let down by the actual answer   which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think    but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole   a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do  create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen    the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps  the actual storyline  is the most conventional   dismayingly so   element   pun intended   of the film    speaking in the vaguest possible terms   the basics of the plot are as follows   in the year 2259   a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth   and only the four elements  earth   wind   fire   and water  united with a fifth element can stop it    figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas   bruce willis     a shady   southern drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg   the hilariously hammy gary oldman   picking up where he left off in besson s the professional     a priest   ian holm     and a mysterious creature named leeloo   milla jovovich      all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming  and unsurprising  fashion   but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest    what remains interesting and exciting   however   after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil   director of photography thierry arbogast   visual effects supervisor mark stetson   and the crew at digital domain    the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last    the frenzied cityscape of new york   with its vibrant day glo colors   tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds   and the swarm of cars   cabs   and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways   is absolutely breathtaking to behold   especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film    but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren t equally as interesting   and are they ever    in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world   from bulky robots to dog like mangalores   the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean paul gaulthier   best known for creating madonna s pointy bustier get up in her blonde ambition tour    gaulthier s outlandish creations   such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps   feel more at home in besson s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world   they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film    while besson s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film   it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience    for all its imagination   certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre    i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film   ruby rhod   chris tucker     a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative  he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress   sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer   speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed    at first this character s hyper energy is funny   but the act wears out its welcome very quickly    not irritating   but just as strange   is a musical number by blue skinned alien chanteuse diva   maiwenn lebesco     who sings  and dances  an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno    the tune   as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra s innovative score   is haunting   but it is also completely jarring    then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout   which too often are silly and forced   a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny   to boot    the story s weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element    while still visually and aurally spectacular   the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be    the big   serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers   and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward    as such   at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here   that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters    this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself   who told me in the lobby following the screening   imagine that   the filmmaker watching the film with the   enemy     the critics   that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half  now titled mr   shadow  is still waiting to be made    still   despite the story problems   the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson   rarely does a filmmaker s original vision come to the screen in all its audacious   undiluted glory    it is a fascinating example of how of one artist s fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams    
Pos,    very bad things     is the most delightfully morbid film of the year   a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn t help but be won over by the material    the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas    the groom to be is kyle fisher   jon favreau     who is about to be married to the controlling   wedding obsessed laura   cameron diaz      the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd   christian slater     quiet charles   leland orser     and brothers   michael   jeremy piven   and family man adam   daniel stern      after a wild night of gambling   boozing   and drugs   a stripper   carla scott   who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room   but after a freak accident   to everyone s terror   she is killed    as robert puts it     there are two options   go to the police and go to prison   or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her      after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body   robert is forced to kill him as well       okay   there is only one option now    you can forget about calling the police     he says    by the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer   most of them are overcome with guilt   which sets off an even more elaborate series of event   that includes much   much more murder   double crosses   and the inevitable wedding from hell       very bad things     which is actor peter berg s feature film directing debut   is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that     there s something about mary     wanted to be    it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh   original   and hilarious   even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence   gore   and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end    the screenplay   also written by berg   is   to put it mildly   very funny and courageous    during the second act of the film   some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death   which was beginning to undermine the humor   but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed    the dialogue is edgy and inventive   and this film proves that a movie doesn t necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable    there s more fun   i think   in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts    cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here   and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura   who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends    diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january    by the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger   and reciting lines like     stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs     i couldn t help but crack up at how   balls to the wall   this film had become    jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original   as daniel stern s wife   who late in the picture   we discover   is a tough kick boxer that should not be messed around with    it is at this level that     very bad things     was so entertaining and surprising    just when you thought you could predict what was going to happen   there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky    the last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over the top    although i enjoyed the film immensely   let me make this clear     very bad things     is not a movie for everyone    it is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen   it is more violent and bloody than a r rated film usually is   and it is offensive    luckily   these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy   since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no holds barred   politically incorrect comedy    the fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and   safe   wide releases coming out lately   still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry    
Pos, it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive   so delicate   so insightful and yes   even so enjoyable    somehow   the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through    set in the 1940 s   the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells   tobey maguire   ride with the devil      an orphan   twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents   he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr   wilbur larch   michael caine   little voice     father figure to the orphans of st   cloud   obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help    figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage   he might as well be of use   dr   larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics    soon homer is delivering babies like a professional    he refuses to perform abortions   instead wondering why the couples just didn t behave more responsibly    larch   too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals   marvels that homer   continues to have such high expectations of people      such is the result of an insulated upbringing    though skilled in certain medical procedures   homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else    he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world   he must go out into it    befriending a young couple who had come to see dr   larch   he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived    thus   homer begins his worldly instruction   with new friend candy kendall   charlize theron   the astronaut s wife   a willing tutor    tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life s questions        many of which he was unaware needed to be asked    he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing    michael caine is   in a word   brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans   many of whom he helped to bring into the world    calling them   princes of maine   kings of new england   in his ritualistic goodnight   mr   caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine    delroy lindo   a life less ordinary   has many powerful moments as mr   rose   the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins    director lasse hallstrom   what s eating gilbert grape     and screenwriter/novelist john irving   the world according to garp     who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter    regardless of one s personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion   it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers    the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers    figuring the rules didn t apply to them since they didn t have a hand in writing them   they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along    dr   larch   in his own way   acts similarly    there is a danger in that line of reasoning    god has also given us a set of rules    unlike the list posted in the cider house   god s rules   if followed   promise us benefits beyond our imagination    and yet   many continue to ignore his   rules   preferring to make up their own as they go through life       trust in the lord with all thine heart   and lean not unto thine own understanding      proverbs 3   5 [kjv]  just as a builder follows a designer s blueprint or a conductor follows a composer s score   why shouldn t we follow the rules of life given to us by life s architect for our own blessing    
Pos, known as the most successful   highest grossing romantic comedy in history   director garry marshall apparently struck gold with   pretty woman     which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but   thanks to positive word of mouth   was able to reach upwards of $175 million in theaters alone    the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film s two charismatic stars   richard gere and julia roberts   since the story itself is none too original or even believable    the other winning element that makes   pretty woman   so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence   which is rarely as palpable in today s films as it is here    edward lewis   richard gere   is a suave   extremely wealthy business mogul who   at the start of the picture   breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument   and abruptly takes his friend s car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel    stopping the car along the street   he asks a woman   obviously a prostitute   for directions    agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks   edward ultimately accepts   they strike up a conversation   and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor    this meeting does not lead to sex   however   as edward confides that he d rather just have someone to talk to   and offers her $300 to spend the night    just as well   since the hooker   named vivian   is a beautiful   generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear    the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned   when edward finally offers to pay vivian three thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area   keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get togethers    since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips   which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers   the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act   edward and vivian will finally   truly   kiss    allegedly planned as a grim   downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director     pretty woman   has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale   a la   cinderella      the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been    you honestly don t need a high iq   or any iq   for that matter   to guess how the film will end   and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha    the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less than gratifying   and the screenplay is no award winner    and yet   amidst all of these qualms and flaws     pretty woman   is an astoundingly charming motion picture   and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers    you d actually be amazed how far bemusement can go   and there are a few select moments   not even whole scenes   mind you   that are as romantic as anything i ve seen on film in the 1990 s    additionally   the film belongs   and its success can be attributed   to two people and two people only   and they are richard gere and julia roberts    playing sex symbols throughout the  80s with such pictures as   american gigolo   and   an officer and a gentleman     gere branches out here to play a more quiet   almost shy   but still alluring   character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet   and vice versa    julia roberts   in her breakthrough role after 1988 s well received   mistic pizza   and 1989 s   steel magnolia     for which she was nominated for an academy award   is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian   who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers   not for her line of work   but more for her sheer intelligence    it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake   but screenwriter j   f   lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing    after   pretty woman     roberts   along with meg ryan   became the reigning queen of romantic comedies   with her latest being the just released   runaway bride     which repairs gere and roberts together once again     and no wonder    roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy   but also one who can efficiently do drama   and in almost every film she appears in   it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co star    an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co workers that vivian is actually a prostitute   and he then approaches her   making sexual advances    no only does this make vivian feel cheap   especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional   eloquent young lady   but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way   and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading   and if she likes this particular path    on the more dreamy side   the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold   especially one in which edward enters into the hotel s lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress   but also her inner   and outer   glowing beauty    another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward   who is asleep   and placing it on his lips   since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days       pretty woman   does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene   which is a happy ending   as you d expect   and wouldn t have it any other way   that somehow does not work   perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances    this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film   though   because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem    helped along by a warm   memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo   as vivian s best friend and roommate   and a fabulously catchy soundtrack   in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie s overall fulfillment     pretty woman   is a sparkler of a motion picture   and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy    
Pos, the dramatic comedy cousins has all the necessary ingredients   a witty and whimsical script   inspired performances   a great sense of humor   a large and wonderful cast   and the beautiful scenery of vancouver    it s a movie of weddings   marriage   family   infidelity   and  oh yes  love    like 3 men and a baby   cousins is an americanized version of a french film   1975 s cousin   cousine    the plot is complicated   but it goes something like this    larry and tom are cousins   each of whom is not so happily married    tom starts an affair with larry s wife   tish   and to get even   larry and tom s wife   maria   pretend to have an affair of their own    soon the pretending turns to love and cousins is off and running    cousins is populated by a wide assortment of interesting characters and caricatures    the acting is first rate down to even the smallest supporting role   and virtually every performance deserves mention    ted danson   in his first starring film role   finally gets to play a character with some depth and sensitivity    while larry may be confident and charming like sam malone on   cheers     he is also complex and vulnerable   with more between his ears than empty space    as maria   isabella rossellini is a joy to watch   she is shy   sensuous   and immensely alluring    sean young is perfectly cast as larry s picture perfect wife   tish   a superficial and trendy make up consultant    keith coogan   from adventures in babysitting   is wonderfully weird and eccentric as larry s rebellious son   mitch    and finally   lloyd bridges in a tour de force performance is mitch s rambunctious grandfather   he provides some of cousins  best lines and laughs    like moonstruck   cousins is a mix of drama and comedy    the film is larger than life and has a keen sense of the absurd    it understands human nature extremely well and milks it for every possible laugh and heart tug    how often do you see a movie where you believe that two characters truly and sincerely care for and love each other   as friends and as lovers    well   to its credit   cousins is just such a movie    let s hope the french continue to provide us with the inspiration to make films like cousins  
Pos, this remake of   la cage aux folles   features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son s future in laws    the couple   robin williams and nathan lane   are about as archetypal   or as the less kind might put it   stereotypical   gays possible    williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star    they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode    williams is excellent as should be no surprise    gene hackman as right wing potential father in law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles    the real star is lane    his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight shooting uncle is hilarious    perhaps it is a personal failing on my part   but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it    luckily   for me at least     it doesn t last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men   their son and the deception    the question of stereotypes is a touchy one    these guys personify the homophobic gay image    you can almost hear the swishing    if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world   you ll be outraged    but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals   you ll love it    your choice    
Pos, seen may 19   1999 at 5 p   m   at the crossgates cinema 18   guilderland   n   y       theater #1   with my brother john for $8   50    [theater rating   * * * *   excellent seats   sound and picture]     critic s note   this review is the longest i ve ever written and still only scratches the surface    i d recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis      as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace    how do i even write this review    never mind the fact that i ve been waiting for a new `star wars  movie since i was seven years old    never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released    never mind that there s so much going on in this movie in terms of plot   action   special effects and long term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn t cover everything    and also like ted does in all of his reviews   i ll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you   the reader    before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film   many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered   to get the specifics of the film   skip this and the next four paragraphs      as has been made obvious for the last several years   another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars  series   the first of the films was actually episode four   not one      george lucas   the creator of the series   has probably just assumed most people know the first produced trilogy   `star wars     `the empire strikes back  and `return of the jedi    is actually the second trilogy   chronologically    in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order   but i can t recall his reasons    with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy   err        second trilogy        well you know what i mean      and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which   unfortunately   may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution    [critic s note #1   it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed   but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule    critic s note #2   reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics  law of reviewing movies   which as roger ebert coined   `it s not what a movie is about   but how it is about it      because so many outside factors come into play in the film s plot and significance as part of a trilogy   and just considering modern society   it again would be difficult   if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story   ]  first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it    we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker   who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire    we know obi wan `ben  kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force  in attempts to become a jedi knight   but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side      we also know something about `the force  itself   that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it   the jedi      what we don t know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy   which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth    to me   this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle   definite order to all the complexity    also   it seems that we re supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended    most notably   details regarding the emperor from `empire  and `jedi     and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine    for those who haven t kept up with all the `star wars  paraphernalia over the years   there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor   or his voice at least      with `the phantom menace  being the first chapter of a long saga   one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid   including the history behind all the major factors of the series   especially `the force  and the jedi knights    unfortunately   this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained    i didn t liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness    if you re going to tell a story from the beginning   tell it from the beginning   is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes  1 through  3 to clarify the back story even further        but i digress    i ve said so much and yet i haven t even touched on the specifics of the film itself    all these necessary `disclaiming  elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars  series is and this individual film itself    what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we ve come to know and love since the late 1970s    its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar   but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality    the basic story is rather sorted   complex and even confusing at times    we re told that an army known as `the trade federation  has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo    we re not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is   instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly    we re introduced to two jedi   the master qui gon jinn   neeson   and his apprentice obi wan kenobi   mcgregor      the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet s queen   amidala   portman      the leader of the federation   an alien called viceroy   is following the orders of a strange   mythical character   an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears    he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance   and especially that creepy evil voice of his   he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series    sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person    clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity   which is never openly revealed in the film   but should be clear to most viewers    i have a feeling we ll delve into his background in the next two films      but it doesn t take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film s story begins to move along    the film doesn t have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini plot and adventure on top of another    there are so many of these mini plots within plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook    the other films have relied on this type of storytelling   but because of the limits of the technology at the time   the films  screenplays were also limiting    the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace  its unique traits    as we already know   the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars  trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story    and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10 year old anakin skywalker   lloyd     by qui gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council    to briefly summarize the story   jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala s spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation    their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force    jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force   and through another sub plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter   more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves    this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before    in fact   it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before    the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary    by the film s third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot    it s funny how the reality of the `star wars  world seems so embedded in mythology   new age like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence    not that this technique hasn t been used in movies and in real life situations countless times throughout history    and at least it s all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter    it does border of the cartoonish sometimes   but that s just the film appealing to our inner child   which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society    `the phantom menace  delivers exactly what you d expect from a `star wars  film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness    so many things in the film we ve seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited    but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies    
Pos, the story of us   a rob reiner film   is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film   as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films    well   1999 has two of them   the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family   american beauty    the story of us   a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family   is a well written   heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience   including myself   cry    the story of us tells the story of ben   bruce willis   and katie   michelle pfeiffer   jordan   and asks the question     can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage      the film is about two individuals who have come together   spent a good chunk of their lives together   and shows when our main characters are   him   and   her     during the bad times     and when they are   us     during the good times      the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day    ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don t want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer   or at least say they don t   love each other anymore    ben   a cartoonist   and katie   a crossword puzzle writer   have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage   as they have grown to follow different views on life   family   and marriage    katie is the more organized   sophisticated type   who wants to plan everything out   while ben is a spontaneous   adventurous individual who doesn t mind doing things differently than they were planned    the story of us plays out nicely   as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist   told to the viewer through flashbacks    as the film progresses   it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist   with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage    this method is highly effective   as we see the characters changing from year to year   slowly growing apart    through the flashbacks   we get to see the story of them through both of the character s eyes   and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like   as the story of us has three dimensional   believable main characters    the screenplay   written by jessie nelson   stepmom   and alan zweibel   dragnet     is a touching   down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer   much like another one of nelson s films   stepmom    the script has an open honesty and outlook on life   one that is so realistic   you feel uncomfortable at many times   because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar   as most families these days most go through the hard times   as ben and katie must    if it wasn t for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote   which are rugged and certainly flawed   the story of us would have been this year s best picture    bruce willis   a usual action/adventure star   has certainly turned himself around in the past year  he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies   to a distinguished   sophisticated actor   as in last summer s the sixth sense   and now in the story of us   willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script    although i wouldn t pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan   willis handles himself nicely   and shines in a few of the film s most powerful scenes   enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season    where to start about michelle pfeiffer    pfeiffer s performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong   as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion   you wonder how   how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism    pfeiffer s performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring   will be in the heart s of any viewer that has watched this moving film    the story of us is one of 1999 s most real   yet funny films   as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked    superb acting   direction   writing   story   and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film   which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman   make the story of us a touching   unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country  and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall    the film s major high points are the fights between ben and katie   as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed   and although they also say things like   it s over     or   i hate you     you can tell the two still share a deep connection   and that inside   somewhere   they are still an   us      the bottom line   a wonderful   enchanting   and heartbreaking film    one of the most realistic   heartbreaking films in recent years    
Pos, warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest   craziest and hard hitting movie in his career    based on a story concocted by himself   and also written by beatty   bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system    beatty stars as senator jay bulworth   who s going through a nervous breakdown    after hiring someone to kill him   he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what s  really  happening in american politics   much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy   platt      instead of everyone hating him   the american public love him    however   inside his party   more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin    and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina   berry      it s remarkable that this film was released at all    much more open than the rather subdued primary colours   bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name    the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny   and also somewhat true    it s great that beatty isn t afraid to let loose on a subject    talking of beatty   he s excellent in the role of the demented senator   clearing having fun    and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed    even in dick tracy   he was the most straighten face actor       then again   he was the only characters face we could completely see      the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping   which he does with gusto   and also quite well      and seeing beatty as a  homeboy  has to be seen to be believed    it s nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself    second best is oliver platt as the flustered   coke snorting assistant   who goes over the top when he finally snaps    halle berry is fine   and sexy   as the intellectual nina   who comes to like the senator    also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent   laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she s also played   and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife   who all contribute to the fun    and   this being a political film   the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance   as   * shock *   himself    the writing and directing   both by beatty   are above par    the direction is very nearly sitcom like   but suits the film perfectly   and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well    the script is funny   and the raps are actually well produced and humorous   and quite clever    they re not cringe inducing   at least    the script makes many points about society in america today   and isn t afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system    best of all   the film is thought provoking   but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather   and is very entertaining    there s also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes    bulworth is a film with many advantages   and few flaws    perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping   but beatty does it so well it s irrelevant    in fact   there s very little against bulworth   except for the language which is very heavy   but then again it should be expected    bulworth   then   is well worth watching    a david wilcock review   1999     you know   for kids     norville barnes  
Pos, the long and illustrious career of robin williams   which has included both forgettable turns like mrs    doubtfire and flubber   was punctuated with the actor s first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting    it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989 s dead poets society   and critical remarks were unanimously positive    his next role   that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come   was unfortunately lackluster    and so   after a six year stint as a comedic actor   the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams    williams is the title character   hunter   patch   adams   sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting    we re introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies    it s at the institution   however   that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people    he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia s medical college   where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating   impersonal trade    his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion   and the movie climaxes with patch s appearance before the state medical board    the characters are well defined in an oscar worthy sense    although the script does not perform well as a narrative    there s little story to be told outside of patch s skit length experiences    the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters    at medical school   patch meets up with truman schiff   daniel london     an outsider like himself who relishes patch s zest for humanity    the two instantly become the best of friends   and it s easy to see why    monica potter plays patch s love interest   a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school    for some reason he s attracted to her   and although it never gets said   the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view    the script    based on hunter adams  own story    works well this way    the rest of the cast   bob gunton as the villain professor in particular   is solid    director tom shadyac   liar liar   leads us in and out of patch s life in a sound   intentional manner   combined with williams  presence on screen   the movie rarely becomes boring    patch adams  lack of purpose is its major shortcoming   and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours   there s little feeling of continuity or the passage of time    nevertheless   it s an emotionally moving picture   and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season    it succeeds at everything it tries   and only fails at the stuff it doesn t try in the first place    by and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams   but more importantly   it s entertainment for the entire family    
Pos, in recent years   harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence   scowling through the likes of tom clancy s jack ryan series    the fugitive    and last year s smash  air force one    that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system    apparently   it was just lying dormant    with ivan reitman s enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure  six days    seven nights    the lovable scoundrel is back   giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons    ford plays quinn harris   a carefree and slightly slobby   endearingly so   pilot in the tropics whose broken down plane crashes in a storm   stranding him and his charter   new york magazine editor robin monroe   anne heche     on a deserted island    of course   the sophisticated robin and the salt of the earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down   and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting    while some of the lines fall flat   the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche    both actors   who have largely done serious works as of late   seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders   and they deliver their zingers   as weak as they sometimes are   with beguiling abandon    naturally   there s nothing like a life threatening crisis to bring two people together   and quinn and robin s warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates    granted   some conflict needed to be introduced on the island   but this tacked on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes    but the point is to get the two together   and their newfound affection causes complications for both   but mostly robin   who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank   david schwimmer     who frantically awaits her return on the home island    reitman   and old   reliable hand at breezy comedies   keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action oriented sequences    his big accomplishment   however   is bringing the old   smiling ford back    as appealing and charismatic as he always is   ford hasn t been quite this charming and affable in years   he s obviously having a blast   and the audience cannot help but have one along with him    holding her own is heche   whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be   as the plane goes down   she frantically pops stress pills      she can take her lumps   physical and otherwise   just as well as quinn   making her a formidable foil and ideal match    formulaic and light as a feather    six days    seven nights  could be cited as a classic example of the summer   popcorn   movie season s lack of substance    it s certainly fluff   but it s unpretentious   undemanding   and  most importantly  fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach    pass the popcorn    
Pos, near the end of 1996   analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king    the following year   1997   saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom   twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia    at best   that s all it was    a sleeper hit   designed to surprise but not shake the industry    in 1998   however   things have been decidedly different    there have been a number of pushes on disney s death grip on the market   and fifty one weeks into  98   a new champion has emerged    dreamworks  the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed    the other two contenders   warner brothers  quest for camelot and disney s own annual entry   mulan   lacked inspiration and drive respectively    although camelot was borderline abysmal   and can t really be considered a shot at the title   mulan had the makings of winner    unfortunately   it was saturated with traditional   disney cute animation   and lost points against the rapidly changing face of the competition    in making the prince of egypt   dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product    the animation is flawless   and   aside from a bug s life   is the best looking movie to date    the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects   and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with    the key to success   however   was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot    namely   some of the most important action sequences   like the parting of the red sea   were done almost entirely in 3d    dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they ve got the stuff of success   and that they re capable of challenging disney    the story is also well written   and the characters voiced with talent    for the most part   the plot follows its source material    the book of exodus    although only in the most general sense    the writers took a few creative liberties   and most do not damage the story in any way    in fact   the shakespearean relationship between moses   val kilmer   and the pharaoh rameses   ralph fiennes   makes the story more interesting if anything    moses   a hebrew   is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile   he floats into the pharaoh seti   patrick stewart    s palace and is taken in by the royal family    moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert   where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves    by this time   rameses is now pharaoh   and the two brothers   now on opposite sides of the line   face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention    the cast of voices is most impressive   and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock   jeff goldblum   danny glover   and steve martin    the script does not have a lot of one liners in it   and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams   but overall the story is exciting and interesting    it s decidedly for an older crowd   and the tykes who haven t had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost    but for those who make the bid   the prince of egypt can be a great watch    
Pos, capsule   a rock and roll fable   indeed    like a hubert selby   jr   novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan and bruce springsteen   and a ton of fun    streets of fire bills itself as   a rock and roll fable     and the description is perfect    this is a stylish   great looking   and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like a hubert selby   jr     novel with a damon runyan rewrite   irected by bruce springsteen    noir is one of the few truly american movie genres   aside from the hollywood musical and the western    this is post wwii brooklyn noir   for lack of a better label   with a generous injection of rock  n roll and an all around confrontational attitude    it all works    the plot is simplicity itself   rocker ellen aim   diane lane   is kidnapped by a vicious street gang   led by a bloodthirsty fellow named raven   willem dafoe   very nasty      her old soldier flame   played by michael pare   comes back into town to save her   but doesn t count on a whole bunch of things going askew    that s about the entire plot   save for the spats with ellen s manager   a hilarious rick moranis     an encounter with a doo wop group that winds up becoming ellen s supporting act   and a whole gang of other fun little touches    but in movies like this   when is the plot important    the movie is all style   all visuals and attitudes   quotable lines and posturing    and it delivers all those things consistently and with great brio and pacing    no surprise that it was directed by walter hill   48 hrs       who understands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly   and has put together a movie that s a mixture of times and sensibilities   but perfectly unified in tone    when was the last time you could say something like that about a movie   especially a movie where it seems like someone gets decked on the jaw   * and * passes out   every 2   63 minutes on cue    streets of fire isn t the greatest movie ever made   but it occupies a totally unique little niche   and enjoys the position it has    anyone with a weakness for doo wop   neon   motorcycles   rainy streets   the el   studebakers   gang pictures   lonely heroes   and a great looking gal giving the microphone both lungs will eat this movie up    i did    
Pos, jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities   but whom you end up liking anyway    in as good as it gets   the character in question is melvin udall   a successful novelist with obsessive compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible   except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you know where    he s mean    i mean really mean    the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium    every day   melvin eats at the same cafe   sits at the same table   and gets served by the same waitress    you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance   when his waitress carol   helen hunt   tells him he can just go sit in another section   and all the other waitresses just cringe    one day   melvin makes a comment that goes to far   and carol   genuinely hurt   comes down on him like a ton of bricks    at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course   but is also the only person who can get to him   too    another person who often crosses melvin s sights is simon   greg kinnear     an artist who lives on melvin s floor    aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city   simon has the added benefit of being gay   making him a prime target    simon s friend frank   cuba gooding   jr       also gay   does not fare much better    when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment   he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital   and frank   who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor   intimidates melvin into watching after simon s dog while he convalesces    this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage    an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in   melvin gets to like the dog   and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin s softening up to the world around him    it doesn t happen overnight   but throughout the film   he bites his tongue here   cares a little there   and most miraculously   falls in love    one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others    he s traveling terra incognita here   and it shows    good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film   especially by nicholson and hunt    they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen    greg kinnear   who is becoming known for his supporting film roles   is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon    he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist   and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels    cuba gooding jr   performs with a hyped up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear   and comes through with a near constant comic performance    the screenplay   by mark andrus and james l   brooks   is clever   touching   and funny    the best part about it   however   is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting    melvin is a man we can t quite figure out   but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention    carol is a working woman living with her mother   trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem    simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers   but who is still not accepted by much of society    combined with the talent of the actors   these characters make the film    the one noticeable area where the film is lacking   however   is the absence of cuba gooding   jr   through the second half    his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary   but the film ends before his return   leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved    i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general   in addition to a part in the film s conclusion    there s one actor   who will probably not be recognized by any awards   but who contributes greatly to many of the movie s best scenes and who deserves mention    this is that little dog    he plays such a pivotal role to melvin s character development   actually serves to forward the plot   and has some absolutely scene stealing moments   that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal    award or no   however   when even the dog puts in a good performance   you know you ve got an outstanding movie

Pos, with storytelling this compelling   who needs books    based on the book by author james ellroy   l   a   confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years    together with director curtis hanson   the hand that rocks the cradle   the river wild   whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film   resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight   an atom would have to squeeze itself through    set in the 50s   the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities    jack vincennes   spacey   is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style   concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention    there is also the young hot shot rookie   ed exley   pearce     fresh out of the academy and all out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father    the tough and unnerving bud white   crowe     a cop who believes in justice   the swift and violent way    3 policemen   distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction between good and evil    when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation   bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just a simple robbery murder    even after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case   happenings began to link itself to the murder    the 3 eventually reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organised crime in hollywood    the last time i remember a film so clever and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects    in l   a   confidential   you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of `story  going for it    there is not a single moment in the film in which i felt was slow at all    surprisingly   though spacey did a very convincing job as the street wise vincennes   the movie was carried mostly by the two rather `unknowns    pearce and crowe    pearce s exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance    crowe s bud white is the most impressive of all   head strong and temperamental   he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here    superb acting     wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever    easily the best hollywood piece for 1997

Pos, with more and more television shows having gay characters   and even the infamous   ellen   sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian   the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines    the birdcage was critically acclaimed   as was this years chasing amy    then along came in & out   and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released    it s also noticeable that this   alternative lifestyle   becomes less and less taboo as the years go by   and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort    while it s a very serious issue to many   it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety    but the way we re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically    while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at *   it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with *   and when a movie like in & out comes along   it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy    it doesn t poke fun at the lifestyle   it simply uses it to all it s comedic capacity   just as love   sex   marriage   birth   death   and anything else has been    the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids afflicted gay man in philadelphia    if you remember   during his acceptance speech   hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community   and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life    it s a serious and touchy subject   but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy   and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick    it s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual   it may have been more controversial   but because it was written by an openly gay writer   the prerogative was set    kevin kline   who only seems to become more and more acclaimed   stars as howard brackett   a high school english teacher in the small   picturesque town of greenleaf   indiana    after a three year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery   joan cusack     a wedding date has been set   and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story   greenleaf high graduate cameron drake   matt dillon   is up for a best actor oscar    the small town eagerly awaits both events   and both seem quite astronomical   but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other    when cameron drake is announced the winner   the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher   mr   brackett    everyone is cheering back in greenleaf   that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words     and he s gay      the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop    the thing is   nobody   including howard   can understand how cameron came to that conclusion   and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf    naturally the questions pour from howard s fiancee   parents   debbie reynolds & wilford brimley     students   and the high school s principal   tom halliwell   bob newhart     and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious   howard is clean   neat   honest   sincere   a romantic   and perhaps the most incriminating fact   he loves barbara streisand    the frenzy isn t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and   entertainment tonight   wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning    one particular reporter is peter malloy   tom selleck   of   inside entertainment     who unlike the collage of other reporters   wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett   including coverage of his wedding    the intrusion is all but welcome by howard   who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute    it seems that no matter where he turns   a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees    the dominoes begin to tumble as howard s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay    it all sounds very devastating   and it would be if it weren t presented with near perfection by one of this year s most delightful ensemble casts    kline seems only to improve with age   and he is downright perfect here    the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine   and they use it wonderfully    every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever    dillon has never been so likeable   cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role   and brimley   reynolds   and newhart all provide huge laughs when they re up to bat    rudnick s script is heavily laced with wit and humor   and you ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes    while in & out doesn t carry enough to give it four stars   it remains one of the best done films of the year   all around    the script is exuberant   the actors are absolutely top  notch   and we re allowed just the perfect blend of heart tugging so as not to bog down the laughs    it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety   yet we re still allowed a sappily touching ending    despite it s subject matter   and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex   this is a movie that everyone could   and should   enjoy    frank oz   best known as a voice talent for muppets   directs this film quite delightfully   using all the potential rudnick s script has to offer   which turns out to be quite a bit    check this one out    you ll have a gay old time    
Pos, with his last two films   shine and snow falling on cedars   australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there   and his latest   hearts in atlantis   is no different    its structure   beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle   is similar to the green mile   which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books    the parallels don t end there   either    atlantis was adapted by william goldman   who had previously penned the big screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king s dreamcatcher    even the film s content is a bit reminiscent of mile    in fact   it s the perfect blend of the feel good  60s nostalgia of stand by me   also by king   and mystical power hokum of mile    king s atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories   but the main focus here is on the first   and longest   tale   called low men in yellow coats   the film s title comes from the second chapter      it s set in 1960 harwich   connecticut   where 11 year old bobby garfield   anton yelchin   lives in a boarding house run by his cold   self centered mother elizabeth   hope davis   joe gould s secret     who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son    bobby spends his time with his two closest friends   john sullivan   will rothhaar   and tomboy carol gerber   mika boorem     who become something like the kevin   paul and winnie of harwich    when a new tenant moves into the vacant room   the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan   anthony hopkins   hannibal     a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby s mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror    ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature   after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday     dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men   a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers    i won t go into what these powers are   but they re considerably toned down from the book   and don t involve black stuff flying out of ted s mouth   a la mile      atlantis  present day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel s final chapter   titled heavenly shades of night are falling   and features david morse   in yet another connection to the green mile   as a married   middle aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years    atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks  cedars   which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski   the oscar nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski s red    the acting is solid from everyone   including hopkins   who never once makes you think of dr   lecter    most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem   who both had tiny parts in along came a spider    while i didn t really have much of a problem with goldman s screenplay   i do need to point out at least one inconsistency    goldman   for those of you who don t read premiere   writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else s films   carefully explaining why they all suck   make no sense and insult their audiences   while somehow failing to mention the crap that he s penned   like the general s daughter      it s mean spirited but fun to read   mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business   including michael jackson   o   j    and robert blake      in atlantis   which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby   one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back    well   he s not   and it doesn t make sense    1   41   pg 13 for violence and thematic elements

audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre    the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry    suddenly   everybody was looking for hip   inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes    the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost    scream director wes craven   previously best known as the creator of new line s a nightmare on elm street film series   was thrust back into the limelight    and scream s rookie scribe   kevin williamson   burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion    it s hard to understate this last point    mr   williamson has   based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing   scream   i know what you did last summer from october 1997   and now scream 2     enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame   quickly become the most well known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly reading   box office figure watching youth culture since    well   since that quentin tarantino guy   whom   it is said   has also achieved some renown as a director      indeed   in a singularly freakish oddity   it is the screenwriter   mr   williamson   and not the director that has been receiving the lion s share of acclaim for the success of scream   and the print advertisements for scream 2 s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence   while the traditional   a film by wes craven   drapes the film s title in the ads   right below it   in equal sized font   yet   reads   written by kevin williamson     an affirmation of the screenwriter s contribution to the project which may be unprecedented       i can envision the board of wga   licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of   a film by   is attained      and   much like mr   tarantino s screenwriting   mr   williamson s work is vaguely unconventional   incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters    in scream   they satirically discussed other horror films   here in the sequel   the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels    scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood   and mr   williamson s rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel    while the sequel was planned from the outset    a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr   williamson sold the screenplay for scream    the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived   and it s only at about the film s midway point when it becomes engaging    like its predecessor   scream 2 opens with a splashy   eye grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film s principal narrative   this time around   we re following the exploits of a young couple   jada pinkett and omar epps   attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab   a running film within a film gag where the   true life   events behind the first film has been turned into a movie      however   although it tries hard and has some good ideas    the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with   and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes    the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore   where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act   but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i ve ever seen      there are too many knowing   hip pop culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence   and the setup isn t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream s   while the first film s preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying   the payoff here is almost campily theatrical    flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college   where returning characters sidney   neve campbell   and randy   jamie kennedy   have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film    the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors    single minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers   courteney cox   roars into town to cover the breaking story   while ever awkward former deputy dewey riley   david arquette   flies in to protectively guard over sidney    they re joined by cotton weary   liev schreiber     who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film   his role here is significantly expanded    the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory   although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn t necessary    not because so many people have seen the first installment   but because this is   after all   a sequel to a slasher film   what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie    there s a lot of new faces on the scene too   sidney s new boyfriend   derek   jerry o connell   and her new roommate hallie   elise neal     randy s fellow film student mickey   timothy olyphant     gale s newly assigned nervous cameraman joel   duane martin     omnipresent local journalist debbie salt   laurie metcalf     co ed cici cooper   ms   buffy herself   sarah michelle gellar     and a pair of simpering sorority sisters   rebecca gayheart and sirens  portia di rossi      any of these characters could be the killer    or for that matter   could be the next victim    as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay   the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly flimsy premise of a whodunit    one problem that scream didn t have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer    here   and to some extent in i know what you did last summer     mr   williamson s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery    the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements       it doesn t help matters any that the killer s alter ego is fairly obvious from the get go      indeed   the finale plays as full out camp when the villain is finally unmasked   frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes    this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations   scheming   and motivation   that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it    while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived   the aspect where it s head and shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences    they re staged much more imaginatively here   save for the first post prologue murder   which is handled in such a mediocre   conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized     and are much more fun to watch    it s hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck   and a cat and mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged   although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown    in terms of its characters   the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey   who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music      their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour    an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well written    and there s a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed    on the other hand   sidney is pretty dull here    she doesn t have any compelling presence   and there s nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she s the returning heroine    given this   and the fact that there s no strong second banana character for sidney   elise neal s role isn t nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan s shoes     it s no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film    what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast    the film s mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe   well   * almost *     while in principal i applaud this bold policy   at some point you ve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel       i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular   whose casting for the next installment of the series would ve seemed obvious      but hey   as rose mcgowan s character said in the first film     no   please don t kill me   mr   ghostface    i want to be in the sequel !    look what that got her    
Pos, note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    it s startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth    the lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history   continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast    since then   though   disney s animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns   with pocahontas   the hunchback of notre dame   and this year s hercules successively proving less and less potent    with the once seemingly impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable   and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox s anastasia   disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation   the little mermaid    while the animation for the film is   as is typically the case for disney films   unquestionably top notch   the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation   but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music    the film s storyline is fairly straightforward    young teen falls for handsome man   father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter   teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man    except in this case   the chaperone is a crab   the teen is a young mermaid   and the object of her desire is a human prince    what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions    from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric   she s resolutely smitten   and she s such a pure and endearing character that one can t help but invest their heart with her    this simple but touching love story   coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour   makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture    one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it   the voices cast for its motley crew of characters    this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue   which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams  much heralded turn in aladdin   by the release of the lion king and henceforth   the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities    while it s understandable that animated features lacking the name recognition or drawing power of disney   say   balto s use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda   or even anastasia s showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack   would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products   it s unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy    do we really need to hear   say   demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame    is the film s entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice   rather than a voice which best suits the role       i m not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan      fortunately   the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid   although perhaps more obscure   are impeccably cast    chief among them is jodi benson   a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you   who voices the film s heroine ariel to perfection   with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor   and gorgeous singing voice   ms   benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film       she s the only reason i d even consider catching flubber      similarly   samuel e   wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian   the weary guardian crab    he easily milks his lovable character s comic moments for all they re worth   and his rendering of two of the little mermaid s big tunes      under the sea   and   kiss the girl      have become the stuff of legend    pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea witch ursula   while kenneth mars  booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel s father   king triton    in large roles and small   edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal   and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef     the little mermaid is impeccably cast    of course   the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken   music   and howard ashman   lyrics     who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr   ashman s untimely death    not only are mr   menken s tunes unbearably catchy   but mr   ashman s charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film s storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character s dialogue   and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film    mr   menken s score for the film is equally top notch   the sequence where eric   voiced by christopher daniel barnes   and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr   menken s fine score    it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso styled   under the sea   as joyfully crooned by mr   wright   which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song    indeed   one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune    but my favourite is ms   benson s heartfelt rendition of the ballad   part of your world     an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope   wonderfully lyricized by mr   ashman   which   accompanied by the film s most dazzlingly polished animation sequence   packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes    during the song s reprise   which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in   the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking   and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history    as of this writing   november 1997 has come to an end   as has disney s limited 17 day re release of the little mermaid    there s no question that the primary motivation for   if not the film s reissue itself   at least its timing   was to reinforce disney s dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox s costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture   anastasia    in every respect   the re release of the little mermaid appears to be a success    the film s 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark   the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video   pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend   and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively marketed anastasia in head to head competition   it siphoned enough from the fox film s opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot   allowing for disney s odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away    but although disney s motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self serving and protectionist   the real winner is the public    any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one   and it s a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen    the little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney s modern animation renaissance   and one of the greatest animated films ever made

Pos, in intolerance   d   w   griffith told four different historical stories at the same time   cutting from one to the other    each of the stories builds to a fast paced climax    in magnolia   paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others    yet the stories and where they are going are all independent    what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized    each story builds to a tense moment   or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment   but then lets the tension dissolve    while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along   even though they are not in the same scene    then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again    it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked    this creates some strange effects    the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships    the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content    we have the story of a dying man earl partridge   jason robards   wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends    phil parma   philip seymour hoffman   is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal    partridge s young wife linda   julianne moore   is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies   but for an unsuspected reason    frank mackey   tom cruise   runs the kinds of self help seminar that businesses like so much   but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women s lib    officer jim kurring   john c   reilly   is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place    jimmy gator   philip baker hall   hosts a popular children s tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector   jeremy blackman   and former quiz kid donnie smith   william h   macy      the film juggles all these stories for over three hours   but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily    each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax   but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story    the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories    the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history   but it really has little to do with the content of the stories   though they all are connected in part by one weird event    magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson   though in my opinion his two previous films   hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories    it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson s company    john c   reilly seems to be a standard fixture    particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight    here he several of the characters are mesmerizing   but that characteristic is not really used    as studies of characters these stories are each worth following    as well rounded stories with a beginning   middle and end   they leave something to be desired    but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through    i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the  4 to +4 scale    heavy spoiler        heavy spoiler        heavy spoiler        heavy spoiler        during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen    and in actual fact   it does    since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods    it is   however   a perfectly natural   if somewhat unnerving   phenomenon    the cause is associated with whirlwinds    we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air   holding them aloft    the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister    smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are    when the whirlwind is over water   animals near the surface   frequently fish and frogs   may suffer the same fate    essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind   held aloft by updrafts   and finally dropped elsewhere    so while the rain is possible   some doubts do creep in    the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs    it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped    it is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon       frankly i have no idea on these points      otherwise the event was quite believable    what we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano    in the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8   2       and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people   and upon all thy servants      however a rain of frogs   though it feels biblical   is most definitely not a biblical portent    note that the previous verse says   and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up            so the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river    the only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16   13    
Pos, contact is the 1997 movie i ve seen the most   five times to be exact    four of those times were on the big screen   but even on a tv   it s a very impressive film    the same can t be said for films like independance day   but that s because contact is a rare example in sci fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects   and all of us know looking back that id4 didn t offer much outside of some one time delightful eye candy    contact s wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway   jodie foster     a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of   merely listening   to sounds out in space    her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age   encouraged by her loving father   ted   david morse     who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola   fl   that was   of course   before the days of internet chat rooms      while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra terrestrial intelligence   of which the program seti is an acronym for     ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on   keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive    ellie s strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist   a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young    in puerto rico   she meets palmer joss   matthew mcconaughey     a writer examining the effects of technology on the world s overall happiness   a one  time seminary student who describes himself as   a man of the cloth   without the cloth      despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a   supreme being     ellie and palmer hit it off   and even take the time to sleep together    it s a weak and hurried relationship   but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on    meanwhile   dr   david drumlin   tom skerritt     who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money   is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding    this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors   eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation   and only a one night stand to remember    it is in this nm city where   several months later   ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space   perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science    when the signal is closely examined   many new developments spring up   and before long   drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at    eventually   it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega   where the signal seems to have originated      the media swarms   fanatics go further off the deep end   scientists clamor for new information   politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take   and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality   remember when zemeckis couldn t get enough of this in forrest gump        as if that weren t enough   ellie s discovery leads her to the nation s capital where she again runs into palmer    contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs   religion    the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented   with no signs of bias    arguments for both sides are intelligent   solid   and thought provoking    when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega   of which ellie is a leading candidate     personal convictions play a more important role than love interests    the question is   can a person who doesn t believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power    even when the film wraps up   it s uncertain whether it s meant to play as an advocate for religion   science   both   or even neither   and in our modern day society where   right and wrong   is only opinion   at least speaking   politically correctly       the ambiguity is an incentive    don t get me wrong    as much as it sounds like it   contact isn t merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film    it s a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours    despite its seemingly heavy issues   it s not a tedious undertaking to watch this film    the special effects are outstanding   though   warning !

Pos, roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton    this italian film star   best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther   has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust    but benigni s life is beautiful   la vita e bella   is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love   devotion and sacrifice    the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni s guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore    like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him   most notably the almost forgotten harry langdon   benigni s guido has a childlike innocence    he ignores the growing anti semitism of the fascist government    instead   guido ardently falls in love and persues dora   a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official    in benigni s tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate   yet slapstick   encounter    guido wins dora    they marry    fast forward about five years    guido   dora   and their 5 year old son   giosue     giorgio cantarini   are a happy family    guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore    but racial and anti semitic tensions are on the rise in italy   and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities    the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp    here   guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son   but to keep him from being exterminated    it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched    for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror   the pain   the unimaginable suffering of a schindler s list    true   many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over   and most were not sent to the death camps   but to work camps where they were used as slave labor    unlike steven spielberg   benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust    his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child    for guido   to save his son   transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game    giosue   must follow the rules without question to amass 1   000 points    the winner takes home a tank    therefore   guido tells him   he must remain hidden in the barracks    he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him    guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates    guido   lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners   instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive    throughout their imprisonment   guido s quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm s way    ultimately   the allies rescue the camp    in a poignant scene   giosue   comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound    the boy goes wide eyed with wonderment and delight   thinking he has won the game    the price for his victory is most high    benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell   a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness    life is beautiful is a fantasy   a fable    it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust    those who object to it are missing its point    and that is simply where there is hope   where there is life and where there is love   the spark of humanity will never be extinguished    committed to lifelong learning through effective communication  
Pos, larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar and the owner/publisher of the multi million dollar hustler publications company    the people vs   larry flynt is the story of larry flynt s fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine   hustler    based on a true story   the film is almost a documentary in that it s a very vivid and detailed look at larry flynt s life    woody harrelson gives an excellent performance    he conveys flynt s peculiarities and his character with depth and focus    by the end of the film the audience actually finds themselves   somewhat grudgingly   liking larry flynt    this is some feat given flynt s apparent lack of any morals or ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court    however   flynt has a number of things going for him   he s rich   he s funny   and most importantly   he says exactly what he means    larry flynt s wife   althea leasure is played by courtney love    larry meets althea at one of his clubs   and they fall in love   a very sexual and open love      both of them indulge in a world of too much sex   and eventually too much drugs    flynt had been taking an excessive amount of pain killers after being paralysed from the waist down   which was especially upsetting for him   by an assassin    althea had joined him in taking the drugs    following an operation flynt decides to stop taking drugs   althea does not have any such plans   nor the determination to follow them    as the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail and sick    courtney love obviously has a great understanding for althea s situation   as she is brilliant in portraying althea in every respect    it s extremely sad to watch althea literally wither away    edward norton plays flynt s lawyer   alan isaacman    again   this is a solid performance    the audience finds it easy to sympathise with isaacman who somehow puts up with flynt s courtroom antics    flynt is not only childish in the courtroom   but downright rude to the judges   and lands himself in a lot of trouble   and even in a mental institution   because of it    isaacman is very easy to like   and great at proving   in quite clever ways   his points to the court    milos forman has done a great job in directing the people vs   larry flynt    it is not really an exciting or thrilling film   but instead a highly interesting portrayal of a true story    due to larry s character it is also   at times   a very funny film    however   it is much more than that    it is about the fight for freedom of speech   anti censorship   and the right to be able choose for oneself what to see and buy    an excellent look at flynt   his life   and his story    keep a look out for the real larry flynt who makes a cameo as judge morrissey    
Pos, virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre    since  dark city    1998     films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another    the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix    all the films released after it   have been less successful    david cronenberg s existenz   released only a couple of months after the matrix   was accepted and even appreciated   by some     but the hype was gone    and when  the thirteenth floor  aired this fall   it was completely overseen and ignored    i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying   feeling like eating the same meal over and over again    it was therefore i was less than excited   when i went out to see to  the thirteenth floor     however   i was positively surprised by josef rusnak s latest picture    matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality   combining the best of hollywood s action and effects with an intelligent story    existenz was a violent   gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality   ending in blood and madness     the thirteenth floor  is somewhere in between    instead of going after the crowds   the action audience   like the matrix     or aiming at the horror fans   like existenz      the thirteenth floor  presents a more intelligent plot   witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience   that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding    in a near future       on  the thirteenth floor of a classified building   a genius scientist   hannon fuller   has created a simulated world   his personal dreamworld   where every inhabitant is a complex   selflearning program that only believes it is real    right after the first testing of this world   fuller     is found murdered    douglas hall       his closest friend and business partner   immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth    a beautiful woman   gretchen mol   who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery   which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence    the first   download into simulation   is impressive    it is the creator s first visit to his world   his creation    in order to enter this virtual universe   you have to take over someone s identity   become another person    this is called conciseness transfer   and this is part of the tragedy in the film   people   wake up   in unknown places and strange things start happen    they start to doubt in their own sanity    these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their   users   and creators with their sanity and their lives    it is a frightening reality   the fact that all the people in the simulation   the program links   are living out their lives   oblivious   not knowing that they are puppets in someone s fantasy    with an appealing     blade runner     type   of detective story   this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present    our modern world is metal and glass    cold   unfriendly   impersonal    the thirties are different    colorful   beautiful   elegant   virile    this contrast demonstrates a wish for change    virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical   enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities    to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise   to some a personal playground    a life without any consequences    for others   a way to start over and   correct   their mistakes   by living in an illusion of their past    virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes   dreams and fantasies to life    at least that s how it is all beginning    but when you re waking up from your dream   the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise    this   almost narcotic effect   soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness    some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised    what is real    what is thought    who are we    if these were answered   this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made    they are off course not answered   but posed in an intelligent manner    the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements   since it portrays the contrast between these computer simulated universes    kirk m   petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour   grace and color   and setting this world in opposition to our own    an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties    there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose s moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time    a rather unusual thing about the thirteenth floor  is the almost complete lack of special effects    there are no cgi animated creatures   no bullets in slow motion    this is a more philosophical approach   reminding about the european way of filmmaking    this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians   but the more serious science fiction buffs and  dark city  fans will be pleased    this film is interesting and inspiring    it has everything existenz doesn t   but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix    and then there is a happy end which   like in  dark city    completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context    the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think   since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics   including blade runner and  dark city     with this in mind    the thirteenth floor  doesn t make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now   yet this is a beautiful   elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality    
Pos, i don t know what movie the critics saw   but it wasn t this one    the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring    in my personal opinion   they couldn t be more wrong    if you were expecting airplane !  like  laughs and agatha christie intense mystery   then yes   this movie would be a disappointment    however   if you re just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time   this is one to see    honest   it is    this story is about a 4th network   wbn   taking to america s airwaves in 1939    penny henderson   mary stuart masterson     the station owner s secretary   must deal with her overbearing boss   an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment s notice   partly due to the fact that they haven t been paid in weeks    among the mayhem   she must also deal with her soon to be ex husband   roger   brian benben   who desperately wants her back    unfortunately   her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation    while trying to woo penny back   roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn    mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny   i m trying to be unbiased so i won t tell you how amazing she looked     although brian benben gets most of the screen time    along with the two leads   are several recognizable faces   including corbin bernsen   l   a    law     michael mckean   laverne & shirley   and bobcat goldthwait    the special effects are amazing   and fooled me   which some may argue isn t very difficult to do   in many scenes    although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy   it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie    overall   i gave it   or an   depending on what system you use    some comments collected from friends    
Pos, it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+   the farrelly brothers+ latest film    i knew the film would be funny  the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see    but i also knew the film would be an equal opportunity offender   attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon    i figured the film would be raunchy   maybe another lucky escapee from nc 17 hell    i may laugh   but would i feel better in the morning    i needn+t have worried    +mary+ is the sweetest   warmest   all out laugh and grossfest this side of  animal house     surprisingly   the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side   and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers    they make laughter   the toughest job for a filmmaker to do   look easy    the plot is typical    thirteen years ago   geeky ted   ben stiller   lucked out in having dazzling mary   cameron diaz   go with him to the senior prom    as luck would have it   on that very day   he was hospitalized    why   i shall not tell   but i assure you   it isn+t pretty    he hires a private investigator to find her   pat healy   matt dillon      he becomes one of the great comic villains    upon finding her   he too is lovestruck   and so pursues her   lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped    it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double crossed   and goes to get her for himself    would the geek get the girl    puh lease    the ending is pure hollywood   no surprises there    but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers   hair gel   the mentally disabled   the physically handicapped   interracial marriages   homosexuals   skin conditions   serial killers   tanning   and drugged up dogs    the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission   and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame    and yet   for all the targets that are hit   the film maintains its sweet tone    mary   playing the straight role   is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful    she is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother   warren   w    earl brown  miles away from the cameraman in  scream       mary+s sunniness carries the film here  it compliments the below belt gags that come at you    cameron diaz makes her totally charming   and the audience respects her   even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window    ben stiller also fares very well   totally changing his image from his  reality bites  and  flirting with disaster  straight men to being a     how to say it       a complete loser    braces   greasy long hair   not too bright   and very very funny    dillon is exceptionally creepy   especially with his capped teeth    and rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom   chris elliot     tanning addict magda   lin shaye     modern troubador/greek chorus ron lichman   and mary+s sweet mom   markie post   where has she been   !      not everything works    chris elliot+s role   skin blemishes and all   becomes merely tasteless and boring    there+s lousy dialogue about eight minute vs   seven minute exercise tapes    and there are long stretches without much going on    but the wait is worth it    when those extraordinary sequences hit   the entire theater erupted with howls   tears    belly aches   that in some sequences carried over to the following scene    the farrelly brothers have finally done it    yes   there are some raunchy bits   but when it is all over   it+s not nearly as bad as it could have been    while tasteless   it didn+t cross any lines   at least not with me    while raunchy   it wasn+t nearly as bad as  porky+s  or  boogie nights     and it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick    after the funny but sour  kingpin  left a negative aftertaste in my palate   comes the funniest sex farce since  a fish called wanda     approach this with an open mind   and you will reap the benefits hugely

Pos, with stars like sigourney weaver     alien   trilogy   and academy award winner holly hunter   the piano   raising arizona   etc     together in a single hollywood production   one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot    sadly for copycat   though tightly scripted and nicely plot   is still at heart   a typical hollywood thriller    helen   weaver     after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer   darryl   harry connick jr       has developed a phobia for being outdoors   so to speak    incidentally   helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers   which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes    a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco    detective monahan   hunter   and getz   mulroney     baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer   seeks the professional help of helen   who   as expected was reluctant at first    copycat   borrows   a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases   it did work    but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability   this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also        much of the time wasted could ve been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama    even so   weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments        weaver being the vulnerable yet strong within character   as in aliens   and hunter being the short   tough   texan speaking cop   as in raising arizona      harry connick jr     a very good jazz singer   shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter    which comes to the moment of judgement   drum roll please            copycat is a good thriller    although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show   copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats   in anticipation of the killers next immediate move    this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts    nice movie to bring your girlfriend to          
Pos, no   it is not a bad film   in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose   i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly    event horizon is not your run of the mill sci fi film   i m sure many who have watched this will agree with me    it is not even original in that sense   and it does borrow heavily from films like alien   hellraiser and even blade runner    the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build up that makes it wonderfully horrifying    the story brings us to the year 2050   where space travel have since enormously progressed    the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose   it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man s lifetime    the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years   it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune    a search and rescue team led by miller   fishburne   is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon    the designer of the ship   dr   weir   neill   follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship    event horizon is a sci fi horror film   much truer to the word than say   alien would ever be    while in alien   the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces   in event horizon   the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying    the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb   up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough !  i can t stand this anymore !      there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime    the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also   the acting is only at most   average by most commercial standards    even so   the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film   thanks to its well paced storytelling   disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences   which incidentally   has been quite generously removed by our censorship board      director paul anderson   who did mortal kombat   and his team of `atmosphere  creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror     this picture did not do very well in the us box office most probably for the dread factor impact it has on most audiences   people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this    although on the face of it   event horizon is mostly molded for mass entertainment   many thrills   spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus    however   the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing    my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience  of event horizon    i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us    be forewarned   this film is not for the faint hearted nor for pure entertainment    be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film !  event horizon is highly recommended     but at your own risk !  it has been a long time since good horror embraced the big screen   and event horizon is one    
Pos, capsule   earthy   experimental   difficult   shockingly frank   even for 1997 !     and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops    the first few minutes of sweet sweetback s baad asssss song   yes   i checked    that s the correct number of ss   are without dialogue   just eerie montages of sounds    a young boy   obviously malnourished   is taken in and fed up by several loving mother surrogate figures    then one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation   underneath the title credits   that s far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts    probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life   something we re not used to seeing on screen    this is one tough movie to swallow   no matter who you are   but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately       i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences      the plot is simple but not simpleminded    sweetback   hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man   breaks his bonds and runs like hell    along the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies    or at all   for that matter   the slums   the missions   the ghetto    in other   lesser   movies   sweetback would be machine gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies   in this one   we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted    ssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x     by an all white jury     as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns     and it s hardly surprising why    there s a good deal of sex in the movie   but it s handled in a way that s unsettlingly frank    a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie    in one scene   sweetback visits a friend s house in the hope of getting sanctuary there   and the other man chats him up while on the toilet    we re not used to coming this close to people in real life   let alone in the movies    especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous    the movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today   but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles  hands    one scene   in which a man is interrogated by the cops   is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears   and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack    another note   ssbas is not so much anti white   that would be too easy   as anti authority   and as the movie goes on to demonstrate   authority exists in many forms    governments   churches   and even the paranoid inside of one s own mind    ssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom    and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet   god knows    
Pos, a fully loaded entertainment review   website coming in july !  i didn t really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family    the movie bombed at the box office   and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based    my real concern   though   was the general reputation of snl related movies translating to the big screen with less than stellar results   half baked   anyone      i was surprised to discover a truly entertaining   often hilarious yet also touching little film    it is an al franken production through and through   who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture    for those of you who don t know   al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley   who has a really annoying show on a public access station about increasing your self esteem   etc   although not a licensed therapist   stuart smalley is   as the program proudly boasts     a graduate of several 12 step programs      stuart is doing well enough with his tv show   but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles    stuart s relatives are a mess   his dad and brother   harris yulin and vincent d onofrio   respectively   are alcoholics   his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce   and his mom is in constant self denial and solves all perceived problems by baking    then   disaster strikes    stuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked    he is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself   and there the comedy truly picks up    franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes   but as sharply drawn   real people    although smalley s dad has always imbibed too much   stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy    also   after an accident towards the end of the movie   both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought    although filled with small   very funny scenes   stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments   especially towards the conclusion    for a lightweight comedy   it handles these scenes especially well   often better than many so called   serious dramas   of today    all the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one joke bit    if you feel like renting a comedy   and you haven t seen this film   i definitely recommend you try this one out    you ll laugh       you ll  cry         it s  all there    
Pos,    oh my god   i sounded just like a mother !    mrs   pascal   played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold   tells her son       didn t i sound just like a mother         you are a mother     her son marty tells her disgustedly       i know   but i still can t believe it    i look at you people and wonder   how did you ever fit in my womb      marty   you see   is a grown up twin    although his sister   who thinks she is jackie o   is certifiably insane   marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes    mother and daughter   played in a brilliant performance by parker posey   are both varying degrees of wacko    most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is    the daughter s fantasy of being jackie o is probably the most sane part of her being    mrs   pascal is the sort that will not let jackie o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level    she explains to marty s new fiancee   lesly   tori spelling     soon after their first meeting that jackie o was holding marty s private part when she came out of the womb    the dialog by wendy macleod   based on the play by mark waters   is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment    the script   reminiscent of a david mamet play   flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters    the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family s out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane    in this storm are two sane individuals    the fiancee is a giddy   school girl type   embarrassed by everything   a complete contrast to her rival jackie o s bitter pseudo sophistication    as the two twins  younger brother   anthony   freddie prinze jr   plays the all america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother s fiancee that night       we all have our secrets     jackie o tells her potential sister in law   and boy   does she have a few    this is a house filled with them       when lesly calls it the family s   home   to mrs   pascal    they ve never had a visitor before lesly    mrs   pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their   house        in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase     made for each other     the twin s biggest   but not their only secret   is that they ve had a long term incestuous relationship    they don t like to discuss it   although they are not particularly ashamed of it    perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy   this story never pulls its punches    jackie o tries in many ways   few subtle   to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his    in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands    marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy    the chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing    they put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world    their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best    director mark waters keeps the show s energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace    his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it    jackie o is temperamentally incapable of being nice    and being jealous   she cuts lesly down mercilessly       were you poor      jackie o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished       did you eat pies    chicken pot pies         pancakes actually   lots of pancakes     lesly replies with her usual sincerity       a donut king   so is she like the queen        jackie o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king       are we entertaining royalty      with rolfe kent s whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed    will it end in a big emotional explosion   a murder   people slowly cutting each other up with words   a familial catharsis   a weather disaster or what    the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere   and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell    i ll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise    the house of yes runs a blazing fast 1   25    it is rated r for sexual situations and conversations   mature themes   violent overtones and some profanity    the movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers   i   e     treat the movie as it were rated nc 17    
Pos, i don t know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people   but it s something i used to wonder about when i was younger    i can t decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat   but i m pretty sure andrew niccol   screenwriter for the truman show   has had the same curious thought    the truman show is about a man   jim carrey   whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public    since birth   he s been living in the fictional island town of seahaven   fla     which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign    all the people in truman burbank s life are actors   and the anonymous townfolk paid extras    people watch truman s life 24 hours a day   live   with no commercial interruptions    revenue comes instead from product placement   a staple of contemporary hollywood   with truman s friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones    the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else    even if you haven t seen the truman show   you ve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials   the trailer and other promotion blitzes    if anything i ve written so far is a surprise to you   then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news    either way   you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it   because otherwise you ll probably think it sucks    it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror   reciting the crucial   eat me   scene from alive   wishing his neighbors a good day   afternoon and evening   and living in domestic bliss with his wife   laura linney      but weird things start happening    a stage light comes falling out of the sky   truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father    we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child   sailing through a rainstorm    the death was staged by director christof   ed harris     who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island    similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth   not the least of them truman s best friend marlon   noah emmerich     who assures him he s not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he d ever do is hurt him    as truman s trusting eyes tear over   christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else    there s even a daily behind the scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman s existence    the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama   because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions    and it all hinges on carrey   who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on    he s come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura    most fundamentally   it s just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person s life without the person realizing it    how they coordinate extras   hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors    the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this    sure   the most interesting tv genre of the  90s has been reality programming and jerry springer s popularity is through the roof   but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves    and when news shows use hidden cameras   it s done in the name of the greater good   not entertainment    but merge the two and you ve got the truman show    right now   it s implausible    i mean   the fcc won t let you say the s word on the air   do you think they d let you broadcast every detail of a man s life to the entire world without his consent    one day   though   it could happen    and   even though it would mean the end of privacy   people would eat it up    you know they would    
Pos, no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan    i m referring   specifically   to the narrative form    in the sweet hereafter   egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster    said story   of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent   british columbia   that shatters the morale of the locals   is told in a most unstraightforward manner    when the film opens   the accident has already happened   and stephens   the wonderful holm     a polite ambulance chaser   has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning    throughout   we get to meet the parents of the dead   broken souls who follow stephens like   the pied piper     passages of which are read during the film      but there is one living passenger   the paralyzed nicole   polley     whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify    we finally do see the accident   about three quarters into the film   which is a stunning visual effect    a horrific long take that shows the bus sliding   then stopping   then collapsing into a frozen lake   is the best digital trickery in any movie this year and   perhaps   ever   in a motion picture    the fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane   traveling to meet his hiv positive runaway daughter   as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led pre accident    i have a problem not with the story or story structure   but with egoyan s heavy  handedness behind the camera    for the first hour or so   i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears   these are miserable   miserable people    but that s just the problem   so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while   when a lot of sadness becomes too much    also   a subplot involving incest rings untrue    perhaps it wouldn t feel so contrived if it weren t shot in such a tasteful manner    there are two characters who are father and daughter   when they first appeared i thought they were lovers    i was half right    nevertheless it s worth seeing    the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that   american films are about action   canadian films are about consequences     hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors   including crash and kissed    the sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films   simply because it s not boring or   in the case of kissed   afraid of its own material   necrophilia      egoyan is a fine   fine   postmodern storyteller   whose work is entertaining   edgy and smart   if a bit too intellectual at times    though i harped on the weightiness of the material   i was always absorbed   engrossed   and surprised by the sweet hereafter    
Pos, i know what i would do with $4   4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site   especially if i were with jacob and lou       huh      well   in any event   that is the situation hank   paxton   finds himself in    he and his dim witted brother jacob   thorton   and tubby friend lou   brent briscoe   come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck    against his better judgement   hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities    the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret   and is it worth it    a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things   clay pigeons and even fargo   and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle    oh   and its much better than any of those    sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak show horror monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture    he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do    i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course    one of the film s components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick s the thin red line    in malick s three hour bore a thon   he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story    it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass   a small bird   or a flowing body of water    sure   there were obvious metaphorical connections   but there was no subtlty to his efforts    raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters    i think most viewers may miss the comparison   but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film    and then there s billy bob thorton   who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood    if it can continute to produce people like thorton   hollywood will be ok    he gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here    it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade   but is is just as complex   if not more so    jacob is slow and simple   and yet we so often see him deep in thought    i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say   or didn t know how to say   or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said    here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry    though the plot is somewhat unoriginal   it has a very appealing new twist in its characters    paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group   a far cry from chet in wierd science      perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice giving wife   but she certainly doesn t do anything ruin the picture    a simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un redeeming    but at least this one has an important message   unlike so many of its counterparts    
Pos, i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater   on a sunday afternoon    when the movie was over and the audience was exiting   i didn t hear one negative comment   and i didn t have any to offer    simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys   simon   ian michael smith   and joe   joseph mazzello     and what destiny holds for both of them    simon is a dwarf   who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart    surprisingly   he does   and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle    simon thinks god has a plan for him   a purpose for his life   and his condition   he just doesn t know what    joe is an illegitimate child   referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard     who s mom   ashley judd   won t tell him who his father is    simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem   the people in the town don t really like him   because he isn t   natural      even his own parents don t care about him   and are disappointed they didn t have a   normal   son    he is also harassed in church by the local pastor   rev   russell   david strathairn   and simon s chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks    the only person   other than joe   that really cares for simon is joe s mom   who he also looks up to as a mother    it would be just simon s luck   that he would accidentally kills joe s mom   something you are told at the beginning of the movie    joe   now motherless as well as fatherless   feels the need to find out who his real father is    with the help of ben   oliver platt     the local drama teacher and joe s mom s current boyfriend   before her death     he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way    most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny   although not all of it is    simon will also look for god s plan for him   although he loses a little faith along the way    starring in the first   and last   five minutes of the film is hollywood s newest dramatic actor   jim carrey    jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off   and then tying it up just right    this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway   and he does a commendable job    simon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson   this is his first film as director   but he has written several films   including the grumpy old men series    he does an outstanding writing and directing job here   the film s structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly    the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat    the cast is excellent    joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance    joseph is outstanding for someone of any age   not alone someone who just turned 15    ian michael smith   in his film debut   has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation    other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast    i loved this movie   it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year    take your whole family to see simon birch   it is a magnificent film  an american masterpiece    
Pos, the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be   in some ways    in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint   and its series sequel the return of the saint   val kilmer plays simon templar   an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others    this movie closely resembles a james bond flick    it has the classic bond symbols   a man who can do just about anything and get away with it   a woman whom the man persues   a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal    kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie   although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations    the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests    as a young boy   kilmer s character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork    that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name   that of a catholic saint    he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be    this leads to a devestating mistake   which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life    kilmer s first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak   played by rade serbedzija    during a press conference   he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area   avoiding guards   cameras   and many other potential obstacles    once his mission is completed and he is safely home   the fee is paid    when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $50 million   he decides to carry out only one more mission   then retire    dr   emma russell   portrayed by elisabeth shue   has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion    this new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia   where millions are without heat and are freezing to death    the only problem is   tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people    this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal    tretiak hires him to steal the equations   small pieces of paper   from shue    one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions    they are very convincing   not only to the characters in the movie   but to us    kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue s character into getting to know him even more   which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula    when the two meet   and end up having a sensual experience   kilmer s character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell   as she is falling in love with kilmer s alter ego   a traveling artist    yet   he must reach his goal of $50 million   which requires him to steal the energy formula   putting his feelings aside    shue s character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces   the names of the catholic saints   together   something no one else is able to do    when she finds him   they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak    the saint is very action packed   with few slow points    the sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments    along the course of the movie   there are even a few   although brief moments of comedy    these moments are almost always thanks to kilmer s extraneous   very convincing disguises and personalities    all in all   a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non stop action    
Pos, the thirteenth floor   the third in what i would call   the reality check movie series     is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year   the matrix and existenz    all three made you think   made you wonder what is real   what isn t   and if our world is just a huge game    the thirteenth floor doesn t reach the level of originality   creativity   and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz   but it certainly gives a great shot at it    in the matrix   we were told that the humans are simply a virus    in existenz   we learned that our life could be just a game    in the thirteenth floor   we learn that we are just electronic devices   living under another world of electronic devices    there is just one world on top of another   and everything in them are fake and electronically generated    the thirteenth floor took a huge   risky turn that i didn t expect it to take   and i m not very sure it was such a great turn to make    rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film   the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds    after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller   played by armin mueller stahl   douglas hall   played by craig bierko   a man that worked under fuller for many years   must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using   to the year 1937   which consists of computer generated characters only    the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days    all of the people involved are just characters   or are they    douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours   and killed fuller    along the way   douglas interacts with many different potential suspects   and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller   jane fuller   played wonderfully by a talented young actress   gretchen mol    the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going   and doesn t use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer s interests    i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz   and i wouldn t enjoy it   but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film    unfortunately   many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content   letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened    the scenes that aren t original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere   leaving you wondering     what is the point of this      sometimes it was hard to believe that this story   with terrible dialogue   some bad acting   especially from craig bierko   and scenes that go absolutely nowhere   are actually true    i know this isn t a true story or anything   but a film should be able to make you think that it is    on the plus side of acting   we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor   armin mueller stahl    in the thirteenth floor   he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances    another plus is gretchen mol s realistic performance   creating her character with depth   not just staying in the one dimensional phase    don t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor   just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile   and shuts you down like any other movie would    thrills   chills   and spills aren t what you will get in this film   but you will just get another trip to send your mind on   scrambling it until you ve had enough    the bottom line  let s hope this is the last of the   reality check   based movies for awhile    
Pos, i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding    it contains parts of bringing up baby   any hepburn/tracy film   part of the plot of war games   cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday   elevator shaft action   train action   and murder    it is cute   funny   suspenseful   a little bit     sexy   a little bit      one of the bad guys was a surprise    the pace is fast enough   there are some   action   scenes    i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick    julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together    i really identified with the julia roberts character   wishful thinking   i know !     but i do have better hair !  her hair   a very dull dark brown   has no color    she could use some highlights    they both do fine with their roles   he s a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she s a hotshot   cub   reporter with the chicago globe    they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie    i like the one story focus    other actors include charles martin smith as roberts  boss   olympia dukakis as nolte s coworker   nora dunn also with the chronicle   and marsha mason as a congresswoman    basically this movie is reasonably fun    there is a serious mystery to solve   and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery    it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously    i do give successful comedy high marks    
Pos, plot   jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy    but one thing leads to another   and the next thing you know   li s being chased by the same french cops with whom he was supposed to be working    a lot of ass kicking   face whippings   gun fights and       okay   a little more ass kicking ensues    critique   very cool !  now here s a movie that gives you exactly what you re looking for   if what you re looking for is kickass action   a palpable good cop/bad cop story line   some hardcore stunts and jet li slam dunking everyone in sight !  the film also moves fast   a mere 95 minutes     develops a certain   cute   chemistry between fonda and li   has nice surroundings   paris   baby !   and gives us one of the best bad guys that i ve seen all year    tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in this film    he is pure evil    they should have called this movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing on this man    what a great   great monster !  my favorite line of tcheky s was when li was explaining the whole   kiss of the dragon   thing to him and he cut him off by saying   kiss my ass !    pure action movie poetry    anyway   other than him   jet li also handled his   acting   pretty well in this film   with very little real dialogue to say   but enough to make us believe his character    actually   just looking into the man s eyes generally tells you a lot    fonda was also pretty good   despite playing one of the most trashy and abused women that i have seen in quite some time   but i still felt kinda bad for her   so i guess she did her job okay    but in the end   nobody goes to see this kind of movie for oscar performances    we go to see jet li movies because we want to see jet li kicking a lot of ass from side to side   and this film delivers gangbusters on that front    and yes       they have no wire fu in this movie       i  say again       no  wire work   no bullshit stunts with li floating around in mid air for over a minute    it s all straight action   fist to fist   boot to face and all around cool stunts    if that s what you re looking for   i don t see how you will be disappointed with this film    yes   it s not very original in plot   just take luc besson s own la femme nikita and mix in plenty of his own the professional et voila !     does have an annoying hip hoppy soundtrack that just got on my nerves after a while   i also would have gotten rid of the whole acupuncture thang         and will have anyone not willing to restrain their disbelief   rolling their eyes all over the place    but was i entertained    thoroughly    does the film feature more gunplay   martial arts and over the top kills that most recent action flicks    yes   again    does this sound interesting to you    well   the answer to that question is entirely up to you    one thing that i would definitely recommend is   as jet li pointed out himself on his website   that you leave the kids at home for this one    in fact   you might even wanna leave yourself if you can t handle the more violent of sequences    all in all   a rippin    roarin  fun time !  where s joblo coming from    black mask   5/10     blade   7/10     la femme nikita   8/10     lethal weapon 4   7/10     the matrix   8/10     the professional   9/10     romeo must die   3/10     rush hour   7/10     shanghai noon   6/10    
Pos, i ve never been a member of the robin williams fan club    a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way   and i sometimes feel as though i m watching a 40 year old class clown    in his films   williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy feely emotion   leading to wildly uneven performances    mrs    doubtfire seemed ready made for the same problems   but instead it proves to be williams  best comic screen project yet    while it still contains some characteristic self indulgence   mrs    doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly laugh comedy served up with high energy    williams stars as daniel hillard   a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior    one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda   sally field     and she files for a divorce    unemployed   living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children   daniel decides to respond to miranda s ad for an afternoon housekeeper    he turns to his brother frank   harvey fierstein     a theatrical makeup artist   and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire   a matronly 65 year old englishwoman    daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda s flirtation with a wealthy client   pierce brosnan     to spend time with the children   and to learn something about responsible parenting   all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best    mrs   doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work   and basically it does so    the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel   and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that s instantly believable    it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film   making dustin hoffman s dorothy michaels look like milton berle    more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell   it s a bit hard to swallow that she doesn t recognize any of the voices as her husband s    perhaps the biggest contrivance we re asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs   doubtfire in a few minutes    there s more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask    fortunately   these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll    during the film   i was generally too busy laughing    after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams  riffing   mrs    doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place    daniel s frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful   as is the climactic restaurant sequence   even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away    clearly   most of the credit for doubtfire s success goes to robin williams    it took putting him in drag   but for once he plays a comic character that isn t just robin williams with a different name    he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire   and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul mouthed    wisely   he never aims for saintly    his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty   but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity    it s one of mrs    doubtfire s charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect   just people trying to be better    as miranda   sally field is solid in a background role   and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu    the children are also good   although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest    the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing    it s easy to see mrs    doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over   and it s true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common    but mrs    doubtfire manages to carve out its own space   particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge s decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda s relationship    there s nothing dazzlingly new in mrs    doubtfire   but there are plenty of laughs   and good comedies are always in short supply    and it s nice to see robin williams just act for a change    
Pos, weir is well respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject matter into deceptively simple   powerful films   the mosquito coast   utopia   and fearless   post traumatic stress disorder   among them    in the truman show   weir essentially breathes life into the now tired concept of media manipulation by tackling the material from the inside out    it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top form playing the title character   truman burbank    by now you must be aware of the premise   unbeknownst to him   truman   carrey   is the star of his own tv series   a 24 7 peep show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations   people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants    `seahaven    his hometown   and the show itself   are the brainchild of christof   harris     who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon   directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras    for 30 years   truman suspects nothing `we accept the reality we re given     poses christof but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji    mcelhone   who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement   overwhelms him    thus   christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact   lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly rated program    in a few broad strokes   weir creates a convincing second reality   and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three quarters through    this allows us to comprehend and accept truman s world before we contextualize it    for all his madness   christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship   and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it    truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be   well   so darn nice   like a sibling   or   perhaps more appropriately   a caged animal in an interactive zoo     they want to see him succeed    the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey he really is an everyman here   abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible   wide eyed bewilderment    cinematically   the truman show is impeccable   stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images    as well   it employs wojciech kilar s piece   zycie za zycie  masterfully and beautifully    if the film has any flaws   one may find them in laura linney s characterization as meryl   truman s   wife     i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone     and in a subplot involving truman s `father    which feels curiously incomplete    there are a few stupendous sequences   and the film pulls off a wonderful trick   we become truman s audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film    they wear buttons asking `how will it end      i couldn t wait to know myself   though i didn t exactly want it to end   for this inspired movie is possibly the best and most complex summer picture in years    
Pos, synopsis   it s 1977 in a small italian american neighborhood in new york    disco music is popular   and the sexual revolution is on   but the people of new york are not happy    in fact   they re terrified    as in spike lee s do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip   and peoples  tempers are flaring    the cool of night offers no respite   the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam    no one knows who the son of sam is   and no one is safe    all around new york people are different    aside from cultural groupings and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals    in the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny   john leguizamo   tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna   mira sorvino      vinny s friend ritchie   adrien brody   hates disco   works at a gay strip club and doesn t want any of the neighborhood folks to know    ritchie s girl ruby   jennifer esposito   is trying to escape a reputation as a slut    everyone s different   but nobody in the film wants to be framed as   alien   to the community    unfortunately   the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor    opinion   director spike lee s summer of sam is not about a psycho killer    nor is it about cops trying to apprehend him    it s about differences and how   given the right conditions   even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion    one thing i found interesting in summer of sam was the use of sex    in other movies sex is glamorized    for example   james bond gets a sexual reward for winning    or boring made for video   suspense   movies are spiked with gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake    and every movie or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual prowess    not so with summer of sam    in a very gutsy move director spike lee shows sex without fantasy    sex is there   but it isn t gratuitous or titillating    in fact   some of the main characters are downright lousy in bed    sex is in the film because   sexual   deviance is part of the film s major theme of   difference   breeding hostility    in my opinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for 1999   as rare and thought provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking    
Pos, part one of   the strangest movies ever made   series at www   mediajunkies   com  by scott watson  [light spoilers   nothing you shouldn t read]  existenz has been called   a gooey matrix     and while this is a correct description in some ways   in others it is completely off    the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal     real   reality    a major difference is that   the matrix   has a base reality that is obviously the true reality   while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true    and oh what a reality it is    david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies   naked lunch   crash     but this one is one of the strangest    maybe it s because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre    technology is organic   but only some of it    cars are normal    gas stations are the same    cell phones are glowing bug like appendages    you jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus   referred to simply as a   pod        high technology has been replaced with organic creatures   and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters    a famous game designer   allegra geller   a fine looking jennifer jason leigh     flees a demonstration of her latest game   existenz   after an assassination attempt    she is on the run   from who   i m still not sure     and has to save her pod by playing her game with   someone friendly      that someone friendly is her dubious companion and security guard   ted pikul   jude law      unfortunately he is lacking a fundamental requirement for playing   a bioport    sort of a hole in your spine   ok   exactly like a hole in your spine     a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail looking wires from the pod into you   allowing you to play the game    luckily a bioport can be installed easily   they install them in malls     so off they go to get one    after a crazy series of events at the local country gas station   they are able to plug in and play existenz    the plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies   reality distortion   chinese restaurants   and multi appendaged amphibian things     it s a sign of the times        but the plot   while cohesive in it s own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe    cronenberg just slaps this weird organic tech world into the viewers lap   and it s up to you to figure out how all these things work    and that s the true joy of this film   entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place    you learn a little bit piece by piece   oh   they make pods out of those     and it s just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you    there are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around   including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards    also the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz   the specifics of which i will leave for you to discover    there s lots of little things that set off the weird o meter   like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store   the two headed amphibian creature   and why that guy at the gas station s name appears to be   gas      it all adds up to a supremely far out trip   and given the choice i think i would rather live in the matrix s virtual world        oh wait   i already do    
Pos, good films are hard to find these days    great films are beyond rare    proof of life   russell crowe s one two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller   is one of those rare gems    a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting   an intelligent script   and masterful directing   together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days   genuine motivation in a story that rings true    consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe s character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan s character in the film    all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world    i haven t seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah s masterpiece   the getaway    but enough with the gossip   let s get to the review    the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman   david morse     an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti government soldiers    upon discovering his identity   the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million    the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off   and no one will step forward with the money    with no choice available to her   bowman s wife alice   ryan   hires terry thorne   crowe     a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative   to arrange the return of her husband    but when things go wrong    as they always do in these situations    terry and his team   which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year   david caruso   take matters into their own hands    the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character driven vehicle filled with well written dialogue   shades of motivation   and convincing acting by all the actors    the script is based on both a book   the long march to freedom   and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations   and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy   screenwriter of the devil s advocate and dolores claiborne    the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan   but that between crowe and david caruso    dug out from b movie hell   caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe s right hand gun while providing most of the film s humor    ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes   david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him   and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic   gunslinger character of terry thorne    the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes    the bulk of those scenes   which bookend the movie   work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story s characters    the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise    director taylor hackford mixes both his old school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film    proof of life is a thinking man s action movie    it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war   and the sacrifices one makes for those choices    the sacrifices that help you sleep at night    
Pos, i must admit i m going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity   because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend    the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity    i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre   but something drew me to this film    maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role   and the hilarious eugene levy    maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity   con air   and pushing tin    but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life    the story of serendipity is simple    two people   john trager   john cusack   and sara thomas   kate beckinsale   looking ever so hot     have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves    with buck henry smack dab in the middle    charmed beyond repair   these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf   called serendipity   talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down   and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink    but with each of them already involved with other parties   sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera    sara declares that if this   thing      let s just call it love    is destined to happen   fate will bring them together in the future    years later and on opposite coasts of america   john and sara    both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates    decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts    what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat and mouse game with the fates   involving such items as mistaken identity   a graduate homage   john corbett as a freaky new age musician   and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman    to find out if that   thing   was right after all    fortunately   first time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong   well rounded   characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative    coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom   director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones   and the use of time lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years    the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity    both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters  on the flipside   films such as you ve got mail   made in heaven   and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film s main journey at hand    but it s what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture    
Pos, in some regards   making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it    try too hard   and it snaps   but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther    in simon birch   director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique   he takes advantage of caution and poise   but also risks his movie with a few bold steps    in the end   he s not only holding an unbroken band   but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature    there s no doubt about it   the film that johnson has crafted is rich    he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown   maine   leaves turn bright orange in the fall   the grass is a lush green   pure white snow falls in the winter   and the sky goes on forever    the characters continue that turn   our two leads are simon birch   ian michael smith   and joe wenteworth   joseph mazzello      simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital   and by age twelve he s only two feet tall    joe is the bastard son of rebecca   ashley judd     and by age twelve he s ready to know who is father is    naturally   the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together   from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball    in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith   simon birch is convinced that he s god s instrument   and there must be a reason he s so small    joe doesn t quite buy it   but he sticks by simon   the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other s only true friends    early on   the two meet up with ben goodrich   oliver platt     rebecca s new boyfriend   and although the bond isn t immediate   ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other    both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability    the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon   a testament to the acting jobs of both    finally   jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day   and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show    mark steven johnson s sense of drama and writing is fantastic    the script is loosely based on john irving s novel   a prayer for owen meany   but it s so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from  based on  to  suggested by      along those same lines   it s almost unfitting to compare the two   johnson uses tension   humor   atmosphere   and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions    by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity   gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks   but the winning idea remains the same    simon birch is a different look at a different life   and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come    in the present   however   it s an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at    
Pos, on the basis of this film alone   i never would have predicted that   in two years   quentin tarantino would become the country s biggest hotshot director    reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction   but is a much less substantive   more conventional crime story than the big pf    here s what the two movies do have in common          scenes of intelligent   amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot   a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical   chronological sequence   graphic yet necessary violence   an engaging crime story   dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial/gender slurs   three of the same actors   harvey keitel   tim roth and steve buscemi     a mexican standoff ending   although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf  reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it s only got one story to tell rather than three    crime lord joe cabot   veteran actor lawrence tierney   has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist    the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated    instead   they are all given code names off the color chart    mr   white   keitel     mr   pink   buscemi     mr   orange   roth     mr   blonde   michael madsen     mr   brown   tarantino   and mr   peach   tarantino s chin      most of the movie s running time is spent with mr   white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive    mr   orange   meanwhile   is on the floor   dying from a gunshot wound    the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon   leading white to believe one of the five was an informant    the story s background unfolds through a series of flashbacks   of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime    eventually   blonde arrives with a police officer hostage   and what follows is a truly brutal   uncomfortable torture scene    let s just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop s ear    a lot of the time   reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist gone wrong movie   but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino    the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn t live up to   as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on   among other things   tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna s   like a virgin      another scene involves roth s lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana    neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop   like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction   only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie    reservoir dogs is good but it s no pulp fiction    
Pos, it s a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn t need violence to be good or worth watching    all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails    and what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo nuclear war    and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon    a computer whiz kid   david   is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades    but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game   he wants to be the first to play it    instead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad    with the help of jennifer   a girl in his biology class   he starts to play a nice game of nuclear war with wopr   war operation plan response   a top notch computer at the time   but now hardly faster than my own computer    i remember being 12 and watching this at the cinema    it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasn t changed    of course   a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in 1983    i wouldn t be surprised if this gave people nightmares    i hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon    broderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers   although her interest in david remains a mystery      but the rest of the actors are   by no fault of their own   restricted by the script to play one dimensional grownups    david s parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 1980s   movies like secret admirer   porky s or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr   strangelove    if for no other reason   you should see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days    david uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers    the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on    far from any 56k modem my guess is that it s some kind of 2400 bps modem   the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum    the big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights   just like those you see on star trek or any old sf movie   but it s hardly impressing compared with what you can get today    what are the lessons we can learn from wargames    1    make sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers    2   thank you   whoever it was   for giving us a graphical user interface when we use our computers !  
Pos, there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie    action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences   while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full circle    for fans of both genres   however   realism is key    action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic   and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie s end    on this advice   director john frankenheimer   the island of dr    moreau   strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller   ronin    the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing   considering the fare that s fallen into the same category over the last few years    the script   written by j   d   zeik in his big screen debut   approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission   impossible two years ago    a certain number of people will be lost by this   but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times    frankenheimer masters the script with poise   and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck    his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here   and ronin becomes a better movie because of it    robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time    he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex spy sam   a man who s called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre   natascha mcelhone   recover a package    the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast   especially once the requisite double crossing begins   and its role is skillfully penned by zeik    at times   however   zeik s tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission   impossible   de niro might easily become tom cruise   the package might become cruise s computer disk    fortunately   the focus here is almost entirely on the package   whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double cross and why it happened    the action content is impressive   and it lives up to the hints given in previews    the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness    ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish   but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots    the suspense tapers off considerably by the end   a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie s open    considering these factors it s good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well   and it s another good bet this month    since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months   it s definitely worth the visit    
Pos, jay and silent bob strike back   kevin smith s swan song to his two most famous characters   is the best received comedy that i ve seen since there s something about mary   which is a tea party in comparison to the foul mouthed humor in jay and silent bob strike back    the audience didn t just laugh   they went wild with boisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout    in short   if you like really raunchy humor   you may find it   as i did   to be the funniest movie of the year       on the other hand   if you are one of those who walked out in disgust with smith s dogma   then jay and silent bob strike back is not the movie for you      in one of the fastest paced movies of the year   the story has jay and silent bob   jason mewes and kevin smith     a pair of card carrying drug dealers   traveling from their new jersey convenience store home to hollywood so that they can stop a movie    it seems their comic book alter egos   bluntman and chronic   are being used in a movie without jay and silent bob s consent    jason biggs and james van der beek are slated to star in it    jay and silent bob strike back has more and better used cameos than just about any movie that i ve ever seen    among others   they include carrie fisher as a bible toting nun   mark hamill as a comic book version of his famous alter ego and gus van sant as a director too busy counting his money to yell     action !    best of all are ben affleck and matt damon who mock themselves and their movies    the film stops several times to make fun of itself and of the audience who was   stupid   enough to buy tickets to this movie       actually   purchasing tickets to this film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter per dollar than anything in recent memory      the film even skewers people who write about movies on the internet    guilty    although it s filled with inside jokes   you ll still be laughing even if you only get some of them    it s easy to understand enough so that they are still funny    jay is a motor mouth who hasn t met a subject that he couldn t vulgarize    his favorite topic is oral sex   but   being an equal opportunity profaner   he s willing to make crude jokes about absolutely anything    but it is his buddy   the aptly named silent bob   who is responsible for most of the movie s success    his reaction shots   with his wildly exaggerated eye movements   are comedic gems    the story s main subplot concerns four animal rights activists   justice   shannon elizabeth   and her three sexy buddies   sissy   eliza dushku     missy   jennifer schwalbach smith   and chrissy   ali larter      these charlie s angels types give a ride to our heroes on their trek to lalaland to stop the picture    jay tries to put the moves on justice   but he doesn t stay in command of the situation for long    one of the funnier sight gags has the women using a pink   clam shaped   birth control case that contains high tech gadgetry    granted   it s not the movie for everyone   but   if you like kevin smith s brand of humor   you ll find that this is his best    and   as i said earlier   it s the funniest movie of the year thus far    no   wait    forget   `thus far      it s bound to be the funniest movie of the year    in a time when almost every movie feels obligated to come in at pg 13 so that they can rake in the maximum cash   it s great to see a filmmaker with the guts to target only a mature audience    jay and silent bob strike back runs a lightening fast 1   35    it is rated r and contains pervasive crude humor and language and sexual situations    it would be acceptable for high school seniors and older    the film opens nationwide in the united states on wednesday   august 22   2001    in the silicon valley   it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters    
Pos, damn those trailers    had it not been for the advertising of this film   which reveals far too much about its contents   i would have been glued to `under the sand     as it is   the film retains some value   thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling   and a more mature francois ozon in the director s chair    marie   charlotte rampling   and her husband jean   bruno cremer   lounge on the beach    she takes a nap while he goes for a swim    when marie wakes up   jean is nowhere to be found    she contacts authorities   but they can t find him either    did he disappear to start a new life    was he killed by accident    did he commit suicide    marie still asks herself these questions a year later   and in order to move on with her life   she must find some answers    it s a fine premise   and this little movie uses it to the limit    the film moves at a leisurely pace   a bit slow   but relaxing    it s a very visual story   and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles    this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie   who shot the film in a dreamy haze   and the lead performance by rampling    rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie   you connect with her character instantly   despite that she s delusional    the scenes where she interacts with her husband   who she still believes is alive   are heartbreaking    she can t quite get over him    they ve been married for twenty five years    the other actors   particularly jacques nolot   are excellent too    the sex in the film is rather unneeded   but compared to ozon s `criminal lovers    it s the disney channel    likely to cause some discussion afterwards   `under the sand  is a fine movie going experience    while it s hard to recommend as entertainment   it s a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss    ozon seems to ask what you would do   and that s certainly a hard question to answer    
Pos, bob the happy bastard s quickie review    rush hour  so what s the problem with 48 hours clones these days    they always try for the same thing that eddie murphy and nick nolte had    that was the problem that plagued these clones   not to mention the actual sequel   another 48 hours   a complete waste of film    but   at last   someone has a different take on the matter   and it s director brett rainer    rush hour features jackie chan in his first u   s   action movie   playing a chinese detective who s being flown to the us to investigate the kidnapping of the chinese consulate s daughter    of course   the fbi is upset that he ll be interfering in their investigation   and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth  of course   that s chris tucker    what makes rush hour work so damn well is the chemistry between the energetic chan and the absolutely hilarious tucker    tucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity     i m michael jackson   you tito         and chan delivers a few zingers of his own   as well as some terrific fight scenes    the story s pretty much your average fare   but with a decent twist involving the main villain   a highly clouded figure named jun tao    at least it s entertaining   and the concept is excellently realized    a particular fight scene in a chinese office   where chan and tucker duke it out with the bad guys   is funny and energetic at the same time    and the finale s a real treat as well       chan  delivers yet another fantastic stunt for the fans with a 10 story drop    rush hour is just the sort of film you ll get a kick out of on any night of the week    just make sure you don t look for anything culturally different and you ll be fine  drunken master ii this ain t    
Pos, this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city   of james cameron s most heralded film   titanic    postponed from last summer   with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history   this was one film i was eager to preview    so   is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday    my best guess         it will sink   though with many awards attatched to its hull    no doubt   titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made    it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date    to see a ship fall apart   with actual people running across the ship   flying across the deck   and falling to the water   is just amazing to look at    the effects are so stunningly realistic   you would swear you were looking at actual footage    but titanic is more than a disaster movie   and that s where the problem lies    there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise    i ll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you    the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic    we see actual footage of the sunken ship   as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor    bill paxton leads the expedition   in search of sunken treasure    what he finds instead   leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage    we meet rose   kate winslet     a young woman   who comes from an upper class family    rose is to be wed to a man she does not love    we meet jack   leonardo dicaprio     a young man   who comes from a poor financial background   and wins a ticket aboard the titanic   in a poker game    the two meet under interesting circumstances   and the love story begins    add in a jealous fiance   and a not so nice law officer played by david warner   and you have a story that   well   gets a bit overplayed and oversappy    i must add   at this point   that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates   as a woman with   new money   who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship    she is a pleasure to see on screen    when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1   40 into the film   and eventually sinks   you never really feel for any of these characters    the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on    the effects are tremendous    from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room   to a doomed ship cracking at the seams   this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other    we saw titanic in dolby digital surround   and by far   it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen    my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard    when people are in the water   at film s end   you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles    titanic runs far too long    the movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length    and   while most of the first 2   5 hours runs very fast and well paced   the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop   and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends    don t get me wrong about titanic         it s  not a bad as i am making it out to be    it really is an exceptionaly well made film    the costumes and sets are incredible   and true to the time period    the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form   as we see actual pictures of the modern day wreckage   transformed into the movie depiction    this film will certainly win on effects   costume   set design and sound    cameron has certainly made his best film to date    unfortunately   titanic is not a best picture candidate    it just doesn t have a strong supporting story    it s an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside    it just doesn t have the emotional impact that i suspect mr   cameron was shooting for    i predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews    it is a film worth seeing    i predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office    with its extreme running time   and lack of enough robust to get substantial word of mouth   i expect that it will do even better on home video    this will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts    titanic opens december 19th   and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century fox    i give titanic 3 stars      that s not bad    ron epstein  riginally posted in home theater forum ===  
Neg, plot   two teen couples go to a church party   drink and then drive    they get into an accident    one of the guys dies   but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life   and has nightmares    what s the deal    watch the movie and   sorta   find out        critique   a mind fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea   but presents it in a very bad package    which is what makes this review an even harder one to write   since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold   mess with your head and such   lost highway & memento     but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films   and these folks just didn t snag this one correctly    they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept   but executed it terribly    so what are the problems with the movie    well   its main problem is that it s simply too jumbled    it starts off   normal   but then downshifts into this   fantasy   world in which you   as an audience member   have no idea what s going on    there are dreams   there are characters coming back from the dead   there are others who look like the dead   there are strange apparitions   there are disappearances   there are a looooot of chase scenes   there are tons of weird things that happen   and most of it is simply not explained    now i personally don t mind trying to unravel a film every now and then   but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again   i get kind of fed up after a while   which is this film s biggest problem    it s obviously got this big secret to hide   but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes    and do they make things entertaining   thrilling or even engaging   in the meantime    not really    the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this   so we actually figured most of it out by the half way point   so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense   but it still didn t the make the film all that more entertaining    i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is   into it   even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding    i mean   showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! !  okay   we get it       there  are people chasing her and we don t know who they are    do we really need to see it over and over again    how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie    apparently   the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves   and it shows    there might ve been a pretty decent teen mind fuck movie in here somewhere   but i guess   the suits   decided that turning it into a music video with little edge   would make more sense    the actors are pretty good for the most part   although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty   only in a new neighborhood    but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller   who holds her own throughout the entire film   and actually has you feeling her character s unraveling    overall   the film doesn t stick because it doesn t entertain   it s confusing   it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime   despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it    oh   and by the way   this is not a horror or teen slasher flick       it s  just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids    it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since    whatever       skip  it !  where s joblo coming from    a nightmare of elm street 3   7/10     blair witch 2   7/10     the crow   9/10     the crow   salvation   4/10     lost highway   10/10     memento   10/10     the others   9/10     stir of echoes   8/10    
Neg, the happy bastard s quick movie review  damn that y2k bug    it s got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother   william this time   in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on    little do they know the power within        going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there   virus still feels very empty   like a movie going for all flash and no substance    we don t know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere   we don t know the origin of what took over the ship   just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir     and   of course   we don t know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout    here   it s just   hey   let s chase these people around with some robots      the acting is below average   even from the likes of curtis    you re more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20    sutherland is wasted and baldwin   well   he s acting like a baldwin   of course    the real star here are stan winston s robot design   some schnazzy cgi   and the occasional good gore shot   like picking into someone s brain    so   if robots and body parts really turn you on   here s your movie    otherwise   it s pretty much a sunken ship of a movie    
Neg, it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch    based on the late 1960 s television show by the same name   the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover    however   things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion    of course   the ads make it seem like so much more    quick cuts   cool music   claire dane s nice hair and cute outfits   car chases   stuff blowing up   and the like    sounds like a cool movie   does it not    after the first fifteen minutes   it quickly becomes apparent that it is not    the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production   complete with nice hair and costumes   but that simply isn t enough    the film is best described as a cross between an hour long cop show and a music video   both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half    and with it comes every single clich      it doesn t really matter that the film is based on a television show   as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we ve already seen    the characters and acting is nothing spectacular   sometimes even bordering on wooden    claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored   which really transfers onto the audience    the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi   who plays the resident crazy man   ultimately being the only thing worth watching    unfortunately   even he s not enough to save this convoluted mess   as all the characters don t do much apart from occupying screen time    with the young cast   cool clothes   nice hair   and hip soundtrack   it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset    despite an american  r  rating   which the content does not justify     the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset    information on the characters is literally spoon fed to the audience   would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us       dialogue is poorly written   and the plot is extremely predictable    the way the film progresses   you likely won t even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy   because you ll know they aren t    basing the show on a 1960 s television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom   especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand   even one that s missing a finger or two      the number of times that i checked my watch   six   is a clear indication that this film is not one of them    it is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar   judging from the rash of really awful teen flicks that we ve been seeing as of late    avoid this film at all costs    
Neg,    quest for camelot   is warner bros     first feature length   fully animated attempt to steal clout from disney s cartoon empire   but the mouse has no reason to be worried    the only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall s promising   if flawed   20th century fox production   anastasia     but disney s   hercules     with its lively cast and colorful palate   had her beat hands down when it came time to crown 1997 s best piece of animation    this year   it s no contest   as   quest for camelot   is pretty much dead on arrival    even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre    that d be   pocahontas   for those of you keeping score    isn t nearly as dull as this    the story revolves around the adventures of free spirited kayley   voiced by jessalyn gilsig     the early teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur s round table    kayley s only dream is to follow in her father s footsteps   and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber   gary oldman     an ex round table member gone bad   steals arthur s magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous   booby trapped forest    with the help of hunky   blind timberland dweller garrett   carey elwes   and a two headed dragon   eric idle and don rickles   that s always arguing with itself   kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur s side       quest for camelot   is missing pure showmanship   an essential element if it s ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney    there s nothing here that differentiates   quest   from something you d see on any given saturday morning cartoon    subpar animation   instantly forgettable songs   poorly integrated computerized footage       compare kayley and garrett s run in with the angry ogre to herc s battle with the hydra    i rest my case      even the characters stink    none of them are remotely interesting   so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out bland the others    in the end   it s a tie    they all win    that dragon s comedy shtick is awfully cloying   but at least it shows signs of a pulse    at least fans of the early  90s tgif television line up will be thrilled to find jaleel   urkel   white and bronson   balki   pinchot sharing the same footage    a few scenes are nicely realized   though i m at a loss to recall enough to be specific     and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic   though most are paired up with singers who don t sound a thing like them for their big musical moments    jane seymour and celine dion            but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good    aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults     quest for camelot    s most grievous error is its complete lack of personality    and personality   we learn from this mess   goes a very long way    
Neg, synopsis   a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy s mother   a fledgling restauranteur    unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman s favor   he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way    comments   stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned psychos getting their revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry   both theatrical and direct to video    their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they re typically inexpensive to produce   no special effects   no big name stars   and serve as vehicles to flash nudity   allowing them to frequent late night cable television      stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect   the psycho never actually has an affair   on the contrary   he s rejected rather quickly   the psycho typically is an ex lover   ex wife   or ex husband      other than that   stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable    stalked does not provide much suspense   though that is what it sets out to do    interspersed throughout the opening credits   for instance   a serious sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk   it s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men   while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen    after these credits   a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears    the narrator states that   this is the story of daryl gleason   and tells the audience that he is the stalker    of course   really   this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels    if the movie was meant to be about daryl   then it should have been called stalker not stalked    okay   so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts   no guesswork required    stalked proceeds   then   as it begins   obvious   obvious   obvious    the opening sequence   contrived quite a bit   brings daryl and brooke   the victim   together    daryl obsesses over brooke   follows her around   and tries to woo her    ultimately rejected by her   his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate    these plans include the all time   psycho in love   cliche   the murdered pet    for some reason   this genre s films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked    stalked is no exception   it s a cat this time    found in the shower      events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked   where only one survives   guess who it invariably always is and you ll guess the conclusion to this turkey      stalked s cast is uniformly adequate   not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either    jay underwood   as the stalker   turns toward melodrama a bit too much    he overdoes it   in other words   but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands    maryam d abo   about the only actor close to being a star here   she played the bond chick in the living daylights     is equally adequate as the   stalked   of the title   even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong   independent business owner    brooke   d abo   needs to be ditzy   however   for the plot to proceed    toward the end   for example   brooke has her suspicions about daryl    to ensure he won t use it as another excuse to see her   brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house    does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers    of course not    she tries the door   opens it   and wanders around the house    when daryl returns   he enters the house   of course   so our heroine is in danger    somehow   even though her car is parked at the front of the house   right by the front door   daryl is oblivious to her presence inside    the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience s suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character s intelligence    stalked receives two stars because   even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring   it is not so bad that it cannot be watched    rated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar   it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are    if you re in the mood for a good suspense film   though   stake out something else    
Neg, capsule   in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace    there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise    john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films   especially assault on precinct 13   that the new film comes off as his homage to himself       0    4 to +4      john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes    for a writer and director of horror films   supposedly an expert on horror   it is a very bad mistake to make    ghosts of mars is called a horror movie   but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low powered alien menace    in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars   carpenter would have grounds to sue    this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13   the thing   and prince of darkness    it is   in fact   surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way    but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience    ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176    mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear   which is good for the film s budget      it is never mentioned   but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth normal   again making it easier to film    society has changed a bit by that time   but it has advanced surprisingly little    apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control    and from carpenter s view   women have really made a mess of things    society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten    the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9   yes   precinct 9   has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony    instead of having the criminal   napolean   wilson   this film has the criminal   desolation   williams    instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face   well   ghosts of mars    because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner   but they essentially behave as human savages   in another lapse of imagination    the story is told in flashback   flashback within flashback   and flashback within flashback within flashback    ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red   yellow   and black    carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene   showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat    sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup    the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss    his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring    these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience    somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights    within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars   red planet   and ghosts of mars    after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by    i rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the  4 to +4 scale    following the movie i showed my wife   who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did   carpenter s classic assault on precinct 13    her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice    
Neg, so ask yourself what   8mm       eight millimeter     is really all about    is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy   sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography    is it about the business itself   how   bubbling just beneath the surface of big town americana   there s a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won t necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires    or is it about those who can   those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see    i m not talking about snuff films   supposed   documentaries   of victims being brutalized and killed on camera    i m talking about films like   8mm   and its director   joel schumacher    with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit     batman & robin       a time to kill       batman forever       the client     schumacher certainly has that kind of influence    is   8mm   something you really want to see    probably not    the first two thirds of   8mm   unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama   albeit with a particularly unsavory core    then   as it s been threatening all along   the film explodes into violence    and just when you think it s finally over   schumacher tags on a ridiculous self righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further    trust me    there are better ways to waste two hours of your life    nicolas     snake eyes     cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband s safe documents a young girl s murder    welles goes about his assignment rather matter of factly   and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly   almost as if you don t need any specialized skills or training to do this    welles certainly makes it look easy    and cops   obviously   never look in toilet tanks for clues    the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes   like george c   scott in paul schrader s   hardcore      occasionally   a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector   reminding him of his unpleasant task    there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife   played by catherine keener   who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split level home in harrisburg   pa       8mm   doesn t condemn or condone its subject matter   it just exploits it    the irony   of course   is that schumacher and   seven   scribe andrew kevin walker s vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r rated   first run hollywood product    so we only see snippets of snuff   and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror    later it s the turn of joaquin phoenix   who s quite good and by far the film s most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california   to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again    all this to get to the familiar yet offensive   revelation   that sexual deviants are not   indeed   monsters but everyday people like you and me    neither super nor standard     8mm   is shocking only in its banality    
Neg, that s exactly how long the movie felt to me    there weren t even nine laughs in nine months    it s a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man   mr   hugh grant   a huge dork    it s not the whole oral sex/prostitution thing   referring to grant   not me   that bugs me   it s the fact that grant is annoying    not just adam sandler annoying   we re talking jim carrey annoying    since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting    but   on the other hand   since when do really bad slapstick   a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant s head in joan cusack s lap  a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie   and obscene double entendres   robin williams   the obstetrician   tells grant s pregnant girlfriend she has   a big pussy     referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat   but nonetheless   grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie   pass for comedy    nine months is a predictable cookie cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot    hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist    why a child psychologist    so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange    kid   my dad s an asshole    grant   flutters eyelashes   offers a nervous smile   then responds in his annoying english accent and i think i actually have  talent attitude     could you possibly elaborate on that    kid   my dad s a  huge  asshole    more like a hugh asshole   but that s beside the point   which is   nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief    so   anyway   grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction   fluttered eyelashes   nervous smiles      this paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book   especially since grant s equally annoying friend s wife is also pregnant    the annoying friend is played by tom arnold   who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick   none of which is funny   such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed   arnie the dinosaur     you draw your own parallels on that one   in a toy store    the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum   who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway   as an artist with a fear of   and simultaneous longing for   commitment    not even robin williams   who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics   has much humor    his is a one joke character   the old foreign guy who mispronounces english stereotype   did someone say yakov smirnov    that s my favorite vodka   by the way     hence the line   now it s time to take a look at your volvo     another nasty but unamusing joke   except this one goes right over the ten year olds  heads   while the adults simultaneously groan    nine months is a complete failure   low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud   unfunny slapstick   failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy    hugh grant s sunset boulevard arrest   please   no caught with his pants down jokes   may bring more people into the theaters   but they certainly won t leave with a smile on their faces   not after 90 minutes of grant s nervous smiles    everything in the movie is so forced   so unauthentic that anyone with an i   q    over 80   sorry   hugh   will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire    but at least they didn t spend 60 bucks for it    
Neg, call it a road trip for the walking wounded    stellan skarsg   rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it s difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly   boozed out presence    yet this ever reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen   a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama    playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets   unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late    that s an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for   focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father   tomas   skarsg   rd   and his alienated   openly hostile yuppie daughter   kaisa   lena headey   gossip      they haven t spoken in years   and wouldn t even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen   scotland by automobile if it weren t for kaisa s mother   charlotte rampling   under the sand   rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer    in a soap opera twist   mother has only a few days to live       only in the movies   right      too blitzed to even step foot on a plane   tomas hits the open road with kaisa    loathing each other all the while   they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out    whenever he isn t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be    despite his sloshed viewpoint   tomas recognizes that the apple hasn t fallen very far from the tree    kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke   sabotages her personal relationships through indifference   and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper    ain t they a pair    unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one note and repetitively bitchy dialogue   screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward    lost money   roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around   nosy cops   and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative    by the time they reach the hospital   it s time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father daughter conflict   they re also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe    this revelation exists purely for its own sake    aberdeen doesn t know where else to go    weak   unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa    if lena headey were a stronger actress   perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody   haunting cinematography   rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world    the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional      headey s too busy acting   using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance    if she were paying any attention to skarsg   rd   maybe she d figure out that doing less can reveal so much more    it s worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001   jonathan nossiter s captivating signs & wonders    it s not just because skarsg   rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films   they re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen      the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant    in aberdeen   rampling is a luminous diva   preening and static in her hospital bed    despite skarsg   rd s solid performance as tomas   his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow    there s genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders   allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity    nossiter s film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain    if signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas   at least it s willing to stretch beyond what we ve come to expect from traditional drama    aberdeen is never half so ambitious   content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies    when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life    the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan s trite but occasionally useful grand canyon   where steve martin s hollywood mogul pronounces     all of life s riddles are answered in the movies !    even foreign films are taking that advice to heart

Neg, best remembered for his understated performance as dr   hannibal lecter in michael mann s forensics thriller   manhunter   scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on    usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock   he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight     he s only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do    if you want to see some brilliant acting   check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach s hidden agenda    cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l   i   e     which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge    big john feels the love that dares not speak its name   but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad    what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light    he s an even tempered   funny   robust old man who actually listens to the kids  problems   as opposed to their parents and friends   both caught up in the high wire act of their own confused lives      he ll have sex for pay with them only after an elaborate courtship   charming them with temptations from the grown up world    l   i   e   stands for long island expressway   which slices through the strip malls and middle class homes of suburbia    filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a   pretty transparent   metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15 year old protagonist   howie   paul franklin dano      in his opening voice over   howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road   citing the l   i   e    highway deaths of filmmaker alan j   pakula   songwriter harry chapin   and his own mother on exit 52    he s both fascinated and disturbed by the l   i   e     and those feelings are projected onto big john   who follows howie around in his bright red car   but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn t want to do    this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies    he s a beast   but ashamed of it      l   i   e   would have worked best as a half hour short film about howie s ill advised foray into big john s haven    there is unnecessary padding with howie s miserable dad   bruce altman   in the hot seat for a white collar crime   degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle class houses   and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise ass gary terrio   billy kay     a handsome artful dodger    rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui   not that we needed another movie on that subject     these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length    concurrently   the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted    cox   sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo   is all bluff and bluster    dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent    we re so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious   calling haley joel !     it s surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene    the restraint is admirable    but l   i   e    s screenplay doesn t always give them the best material    when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem   the moment feels a bit too precious    director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john   who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach s goldberg variations    it s too much    there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john s other boy toy   walter masterson     jealous over the newbie    this plot thread predictably leads to violence    not content to be a haunting   observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world   like terry zwigoff s superb ghost world     cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note    it s typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet   sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex   philosophical note    in this regard   l   i   e       and countless other indie films   share something in common with blockbuster action films   problems are solved when the obstacle is removed    how often does real life work this way    to extend the question   if a movie is striving for realism   do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion    
Neg, janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy    it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker    this is a by the books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs    it also jumps on the ever popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there   too    garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator   jay o   sanders   running for reelection    denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal  plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that s made the kennedy family so popular    so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit    she soon learns why   easier said than done   is the mantra of movies like this    the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong    garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland   almost misses the bus to town   can t get a hotel room   ends up in the smallest   trashiest one around   has a dog piss on her luggage   and so on    then comes what roger ebert calls the   meet cute      it happens in every romance   the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional   cinematic way    in the matchmaker   it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean   david o hara   in the bathtub   his dog sitting at his side    no points for guessing it s the same dog that just made water on her luggage    also no points for guessing garofalo hates o hara on sight    that s how it works in movies like these    i know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she d hate him for awhile   then succumb to his charms   live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil   after which they d reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits    i haven t mentioned the movie s twist yet    garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival   during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss    milo o shea   who looks like an irish tom snyder   is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together    rest assured he ll do all he can to match up garofalo and o hara    oh   and in keeping with the matchmaker s utter predictability   he dies toward the end    what the message here    sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction   like garofalo   will sell out with a weak script    i was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie   but they actually only have two or three scenes together    leary stays stateside   for the most part   yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole    he even undoes himself with the old microphone s still on after he s done giving the speech cliche    both of them should have known better    
Neg, and now the high flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics   and it isn t pretty    this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer   a version of dumas s the three musketeers    by bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong    whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez    our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting    the end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu    the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay    d artagnan   justin chambers   is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer    he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents    in paris   he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu   stephen rea     who is trying to overthrow the king   and richelieu s man in black associate febre   tim roth     the killer of his folks    he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk   so he rounds up aramis   nick moran     athos   jan gregor kremp   and porthos   steven spiers   to free the musketeer s wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king s prison    d artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca   mena suvari   play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen   catherine deneuve   ends up being captured by the menancing febre   forcing the musketeers to regroup   with d artagnan leading the charge   and save the day    director peter hyams   end of days   obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles   but here it s a disaster    one problem is that   in reality   most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones    jet li s high risk is a rip off of die hard    not the other way around    ironically   there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all    maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes    most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20  to 30 minute action sequences   because they know the scenes have to carry the picture    the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano   sudden death     horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth   and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers   the wedding planner   to deliver his mousy self as a leader    chambers  d artangnan isn t a musketeer    he s a mouseketeer !  and hyam s use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well noted   but that s the only standout in an overall flat production    
Neg, a movie like mortal kombat   annihilation works   and must be reviewed on   multiple levels    first   there s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie    but occasionaly   almost as if making an ironic   self depreciating remark   the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery    no no        just kidding    had you going there for a moment   didn t i    in all seriousness however   and to be fair to the movie   it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints   that of a movie watcher unfamiliar   or only marginally familiar   with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon   and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games    the first movie   mortal kombat   1995     concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth   and it s 5 billion inhabitants      the mortals won   and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth    unfortunately   shao khan was a poor loser   and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway   ready to take over the planet   as our heroes assumed a fighting stance    the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those   like myself   who are fans of the game    i d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie    the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself   and they didn t try to overachieve    there were a lot of really cool fight scenes   with really cool accompanying music     intersperesed with some distracting   but ultimately non intrusive   bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot    and   as we know   the movie was a smashing success at the box office    mortal kombat   annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off   with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie    shao khan has decided that he s going to take over the earth * anyways *   and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament    thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused   being trite   being silly   and being just plain stupid    one gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought   hey   that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now      too bad they didn t simply stick with the formula from the first movie    i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture   but here are the high points     * the acting is truly bad    sandra hess   playing the sonya blade character   is particularly execrable   especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage   a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie       * in one of the worst pieces of mis casting i think i ve * ever * seen   james remar plays raiden   the god of thunder    in the first movie   christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke   a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics    i generally like it when actors are cast against type   tim   tiny   lister   jr   being cast as the president of the u   s   in the fifth element   for example     and remar has always been one of my favorite   utility   actors but he s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn t even have the luxury of amused self awareness     * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important   but then never seen again     * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks   including a muddled scene where liu kang   robin shou   seeks out nightwolf   litefoot     has a mystical hallucination   and then wanders off with jade   irina pantaeva      for these reasons   and many others     i can only give the movie a 2               unless you re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie    in that case   the following critiques also apply     * sandra hess   while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson   who played sonya blade in the first movie     is much more convincing as a fighter    wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer    hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts   and puts together a much more believable fight scene     * in the fights   each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game   and often more      sonya does her   kiss of death     jax does his   earthquake     liu kang does his   animality     and so on    a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely     * there aren t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first   because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between    silly   silly folks    and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud wrestling match    lame and so obviously sexist even i   politically incorrect   for the most part   noticed and remarked upon it     * the special effects are generally better   except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their   animalities      motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie    for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games   i give this a 5    you ll probably like it   but not nearly as much as you liked the first one    
Neg, she was the femme in   la femme nikita      he was the baldwin in   backdraft       sliver     and   fair game     with cindy crawford      together   anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make   shattered image   the biggest piece of hooey since the stallone/stone   thriller     the specialist      the film poses the question   what if the life you re living now is really a dream   and your dreams reality      it s either about a woman who s haunted by a recurring   and recurring and recurring   nightmare that she s a hired assassin   or it s about a hired assassin who s haunted by a recurring   and recurring and recurring   nightmare that she s honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica    it doesn t much matter and believe me by the time   shattered image   runs its painful and pedestrian course you won t care    these two lives   with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig   black emotionless eyes   and black leather clothing in the seattle based assassin scenes   and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes   play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it s now * twice * as boring as it might have been    it s not that complicated plots can t be entertaining    of course it helps if you have interesting characters   crisp dialogue   and a modicum of style       shattered image   isn t complex   it s just stupid    and boring    parillaud and baldwin   who aren t exactly shakespearean material to begin with   are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines    lines like       you don t beg   you insist    i like that in a woman      that s parillaud s character talking        to her cat !  and       you re not the reason i couldn t care less about you      huh    and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film       if you give me a couple of minutes you know i ll charm the pants off you         i don t have that kind of time      talking of pants   parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say   point of no return      we have come to expect this from billy baldwin   but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first    but there s nothing to learn    karen is as interesting as a cereal box   a someone s out to get me crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone   the stranger who sends her flowers   maybe even her husband himself   is her would be killer    siouxsie is the chromium cool   tough as nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the film s meaningless stock title    baldwin seems more interested in parillaud s nest egg   so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot   than he does in her    each time graham greene shows up he gets killed    barbet schroeder     reversal of fortune     co produced and should be ashamed of himself    every now and again it s fun to watch a really bad movie    and every now and again   as   shattered image   makes agonizingly clear   it isn t

Neg, i m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone    sure   she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god s green earth   second only to that movie critic at large guy     but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in   she always strikes out    the crush was a slow moving   predictable piece of fluff    hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in    clueless was an annoying   unfunny waste of time    and people have e mailed me too   saying clueless is a good movie and that i m the only one who doesn t like it    one girl said if i d seen the movie with   an open mind     i would have enjoyed it    nothing could be further from the truth    i went into the theater expecting to love the movie    the preview looked good and of course i m crazymadinlove with alicia   but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny   unlikable characters    almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way    when we were walking out of the theater   one guy   and it wasn t me   yelled out     that was the worst f$&#in  movie i ve ever seen   and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement    so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia s pretty face on the cover of some made for video thriller called the babysitter    i knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway    what i got was 90 minutes of regret  the worst alicia silverstone movie ever    and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like    where to begin in criticizing this movie    the plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier   the writing could have been done   and for all we know it was   by a ten year old   alicia is the star and she s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever    there is zero humor   zero suspense   zero drama and zero action   until the last ten minutes   when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence    zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero    so why does this movie get one star out of me    well   alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub    and if it wasn t bubble bath   the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four  star features   but you settle for what you can get    alicia plays a babysitter who s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party    and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home   at least that movie critic at large guy does      as the movie trods along   we discover she s not only the mostly silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character s fantasies   and probably every male viewer s too      the drunken father thinks she s just the thing to recapture his lost youth   her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside   even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she s taking her bubble bath    they even throw in the middle aged wife s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party    not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy    at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg rated    in fact   i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late night staple if not for the fact that there s absolutely no nudity in it    so you can t call it a sex flick    i ve already pointed out that it can t fall under drama   comedy   thriller or action   so what do you classify the babysitter as    bad    
Neg, so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci fi films such as close encounters of the third kind   2001   a space odyssey   apollo 13 and contact    well   whatever it is   you d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange   considering the disastrous results we re left with here    this is a film that takes a little bit of everything   but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing !  it s like i said       this  movie sucks    plot   a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020   after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet    critique   extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie    uneven   would be another    the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise   the buzz around it had been so so   and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes   all leading you to believe that it s actually going to go   somewhere      but it isn t long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral   features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry colored planet   tries too hard to get us into the   pain   of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix    in a sci fi movie    well   i don t know   much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half   only to figure out some big secret in the end   a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement    ultimately   this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise   joins the crew in their   misadventures in space   for the main crux of its journey   and eventually settles down for one of the most anti climactic endings this side of contact    mind you   if you enjoyed that film s shrug of the shoulders ending   you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well    of course   i don t remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story    ugh    what a friggin  mess    films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again    didn t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script    didn t they read the bad dialogue   the cheezy lines   the obvious derivative nature of the work   mind you   with a director like depalma at the helm   that ain t saying much !      of course   you can t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o connell in this fine crew of thespians     nuff said    neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film s musical score during the last fifteen minutes   presumably in order to wake the audience up   okay   we get it brian   this scene is supposed to be powerful       wow       yawn       my  ears hurt !      so is anything salvageable in this movie    sure    gary sinise does another great job   as does cheadle   the film doesn t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening   and yes   the   sand twister   effect that you see in the commercial is well done    other than that    i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies       oops    did i say   admire     i meant   am disgusted   !  all in all   this movie delivers very little in actual substance   offers two bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci fi mumbo jumbo   pretends to be deep when really it s just sappy   and eventually just settles into an ending which   other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story   gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck    go see the ninth gate       now  there s a great movie !  and on a personal note   i think it s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12 minute uninterrupted film sequences   and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting    
Neg, the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film s end    if you re not familiar with this law   then maybe you ve seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film s end    now if you re a regular reader of mine   you ve heard me say this countless times   you know how drive me crazy is going to end   but is the journey to get to that ending worth it    no   it definitely is not    melissa joan hart   from abc s   sabrina   the teenage witch     likes a hunky stud on the basketball team    adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who s just broken up with his activist girlfriend    apparently he wants to make his ex girlfriend jealous enough to take him back   and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance    so the two pretend to date for some reason   but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud    will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends    will this crazy scheme work    do i care    the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy    what makes movies like can t hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work   and to a lesser extent   she s all that and never been kissed   is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly    i don t know what the writer s intention was with drive me crazy    there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to    here there s nothing        just teens whining about who s going to take them to the big dance    do me a favor kids   go get a job or something        just shut the hell up    in all honesty   the best part of this film is the end credits    now normally when i say that it s followed with the joke         because the movie is finally over      in this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film    after the obligatory second playing of britney spears  titular song   there s a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school    nothing great   but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them    sci fi fans take note   there are brief appearances from stephen collins   star trek   the motion picture   and faye grant   the tv miniseries   v   and   v   the final battle        [pg 13]  
Neg, mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla    his entrance   however   is a grand one   out from the trees he leaps   gargantuan and imposing   sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug   and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have    joe bellows at the poachers before him   angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars    during this scene   i turned to my friend and said     wow    that s some ape      joe is quite a gorilla    a big   digital gorilla    he runs around the fields   chasing cars and people    he picks things up and stares at them pensively    he breaks things on accident   because he s just too big to avoid clumsiness    joe   as a special effect   is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes    as a character   he doesn t quite register    and the story he s been put in is as limp as they come    the words   family entertainment   have never been a stamp of quality   but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart    the picture is a remake of the 1949 film    it s mostly just about the big gorilla   but   strictly as a formality   the movie also has a few human characters    the main one is jill young   poor charlize theron   forced to waste her talent     a lover of gorillas    as a child   she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother   now   she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife    specifically   she s out to protect joe   a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood    soon   zoologist gregg o hara   bill paxton   discovers joe   he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser   rade sherbedgia     who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill s mother    so   in an effort to save joe   jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve   where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers    in addition   the space is way too small for him   after all   he is a really big gorilla      and   to add to the complications   strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext   he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe     and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill s mother    jill   of course   doesn t recognize strasser   even though he did kill her mother    this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young   a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film    the movie isn t really offensive    it has some competent actors   a few nifty sets   and a lot of scenes with a big   digitized gorilla    but the story is really dumb   there aren t any characters   and the film isn t satisfying on any level beyond its visuals    the movie also has bad dialogue    if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue   it s only fair to quote some of it   but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like   joe isn t happy !    and   joe isn t safe here !       we need to get joe out of here !       joe is way too big for that cage !    i don t know if these phrases are word for word   but they re close    as i said   the characters here are only present as a formality   they do little more than state the obvious   of * course * joe is too big for that cage      paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them    sadly   mighty joe young wastes them both    there are a few clever moments   although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment     and   as i said   the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes    it s certainly not a bad film for kids   i doubt joe will give them nightmares    but adults in the audience aren t likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla    a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while   after that   something needs to be done with the big gorilla    nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla

Neg,    in dreams   might keep you awake at night   but not because of its creepy imagery   bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths    no   the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie s brutally squandered potential   the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise   even by tired serial killer genre standards    the big letdown   however   comes upon the realization that this 100 minute head scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan   the man behind   the crying game      he s no stranger to cinematic weirdness   but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope    things start out strong enough   with cinematographer darius khondji s stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat    this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film   there s even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic   seemingly innocent new england autumn   but if there ever was a film that didn t deserve so good a polish   it s this one    don t knock the look   but say what you will about the foolish plot   underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue    annette bening   another asset   in dreams   shouldn t be so lucky to boast   gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn t do much for her in return    she plays claire cooper   a massachusetts children s book illustrator who s plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children    she thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible   soon to be committed crimes   but neither her ho hum husband   aidan quinn   nor the ho hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously    this being a thriller   we know that she is   in fact   on the money   and it s a credit to bening s acting that she delves equally into claire s madness and compassion    but as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims     in dreams   trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense    scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition    subplots appear and disappear    when claire finally comes face to face with our evil murderer   robert downey jr       it turns out his name is vivian   he s clairvoyant and he s got some major issues with mama   a la norman bates       in dreams   reaches its absurdist zenith here   and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists    some questions   then   what s with the garbage disposal retching applesauce    are the drawings on the wall blood or paint    who cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own    what about the computer    does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers    why would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan    is the woman in australia integral to anything    and the aforementioned flooded city   what function does that  really  serve    sigh    at least in my own dreams   i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn t go to waste    
Neg,    knock off   is exactly that   a cheap knock off of an action movie    it s also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year    i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998   but alas   it has already been found    jean claude van damme stars as   i think   a designer jeans executive who discovers his half brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods    rob schneider plays van damme s partner   and rochon plays        actually   i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be    she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there    many things are not explained in this film   but i do know that for some bizarre reason   van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick    where chan comes off as endearing in his   normal guy   character seen in many of his films   van damme just comes off as a wimp    we re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions    to be more clear   i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie   and even then   it was not made too clear    the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong    tsui hark   who directed van damme s last movie   the bad   but not nearly as bad as this     double team     never lets the camera rest for a second   and that s no exaggeration    we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme s foot entering a shoe    fabulous !  seriously   though   i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions   as long as they don t get carried away    for example   look at sam raimi       army of darkness     one of his best movies   features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen   but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story    that s a concept that tsui can t seem to grasp    the special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule *   knock off   to the point where the audience doesn t have a clue as to what s happening any more    another problem with the film is that it looks cheap    the film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night    and for some inexplicable reason   everyone s voice seems to have been dubbed    even the stars    and even the special effects   seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about   are inconsistent    for example   there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window    the car slams into the ground   and the left wheel is completely destroyed    seconds later   the car drives off at full speed    hey   i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie   but a line must be drawn somewhere    finally   the acting    nobody gives a good performance in this film    van damme   an actor i usually like   is way off the mark playing   everyman      and schneider   here to provide comic relief i assume   is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene    even the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over the top performance as        once again   i have no idea who he was supposed to be    in case i haven t yet made it clear enough     knock off   is the worst movie of van damme s career and possibly the worst movie of the decade    and it s not even one of those movies that s so bad it s funny    it s too inept to be funny    there are no redeeming factors in   knock off   and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased    
Neg,    snake eyes   is the most aggravating kind of movie   the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing    it s not just because this is a brian depalma film   and since he s a great director and one who s films are always greeted with at least some fanfare    and it s not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance   this film is hardly worth his talents    it s worse than that    it s aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more   could be totally intelligent   and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely       then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half assedness    or more deservedly   the hall of fame of the eighth assedness    in certain circles     snake eyes   was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa s classic   rashomon     where a crime is told from the four different   and i mean different   perspectives   and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening   which   i might add   is superb    in one very very very long steadicam shot   we meet the protagonist   crooked atlantic city detective   rick santoro   cage     and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife   interupts a pay per view event on tv   chases down a gambler   enters the arena all pumped up for the fight   sits down and talks with his bud   kevin dunne   gary sinise   who s character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn   who s also in this     and watches as it happens    there s a big name in the crowd   and that s the secretary of defense   charles kirkland   joel fabiani     who s sitting behind rick   and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion   lincoln tyler   stan shaw     is knocked out    this all happens in the opening shot   and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction    what really happened   this film asks   and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene       and  discovers there s a very good possibility it was a conspiracy    as we follow rick trying to learn of more information   we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot   carla gugino     and who flees the scene in a panic   and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness  takes on what happened    this is all going pretty fine and dandy   and it s extremely interesting to watch       then  it takes one wrong step    we follow the wrong character   and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on   and way before rick can find it out    but that s not the worst part of it   it s that it s the one person you didn t think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring   the one you didn t think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it    it only gets worse   the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film   and since we already know what happened   we can t rely on rick s investigation to be all that interesting    it s as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in   and decided to just fall back on an easy way out   and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible    events become more and more proposterous   and by the end   the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this   the deux ex machina    that s where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay    this time   it s a hurricane   an out of control police car   and a big round ball that adorned the arena    what went wrong    depalma and the screenwriter   david koepp   are extremely credible people in their respective fields   and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this    depalma   who idolizes hitchcock to death   has done many a film like this   such as his masterpiece     blow out     where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece    but granted   depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch   what with his over the top shot set ups   notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel   forgetting anything about boundaries    at least his direction makes up partly for it    then there s koepp   who showed such great ability at making a character s flaws come to life like he did in depalma s earlier   carlito s way     a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well    he can write a flawed character   but his rick santoro seems to be just a half assed effort    he s flawed   and we can see redemption if the story wasn t so formulaic    a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup    he may as well have said the opposite of what he says   it would have at least gone with what the character was like    this is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity   because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption   then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way    as i was watching the first half hour   i couldn t wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed   how many different perspectives he d be given   and perhaps he d have to make a choice between who s he has to believe    now there s a film    unfortunately   the film has two major deux ex machinas   one in the disasterous ending   the other   about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we ve seen all too much before   but never from someone like depalma    
Neg, forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects    set in 1692 at salem   massachusetts   the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon    they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells    then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes    not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor   daniel day lewis     abigail   winona ryder   suddenly seizes a chicken   beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood    taking even adolescent hormone surges into account   surely this chicken bashing bit is a bit excessive   especially for prim puritan sensibilities    surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets    the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller s name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play    this is far from a harmless event   a bad start to an already shaky morality tale    the play describes the film s opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply   and this adds to the play s charged atmosphere    in the film   the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora s box    not only is credulity stretched but abigail s obsession is unfortunately spotlighted    it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts   it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot    not surprisingly   the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning   witches are invoked by those eager to blame    when the girls are questioned   their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses   led lustfully by abigail    with alarming synchronicity our hormonally advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents   constant reminders that abigail s passion sets all this into inexorable motion    abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor s love   his wife elizabeth   joan allen     by including her among those accused of witchcraft    appropriately narrow waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile   watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow     day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over earnestness that longs to be watched    director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis  foaming mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration    otherwise   hytner s direction is unremarkable    ryder s performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings    her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful    abigail supposedly revels in her newfound power   but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here    paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth   but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves    probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing   allen s elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character    a scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed    unfortunately   when john s audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost    it is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions    his screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message    the result is a clumsy muddle   i felt like the chicken from the opening scene   head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy handed to be wholly believable    when the gallows beckoned   it was sweet release indeed    far from bewitching   the crucible tests the patience    
Neg, one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean luc godard film    after all   he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave    he is also an esteemed film critic   lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing    however   his latest creation   in praise of love   is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year    the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit   to dissect love into the following four categories   meeting   physical passion   quarrels   and reconciliation    these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples   young   adult   and elderly    it is edgar s   bruno putzulu   self appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup   to define a central idea     it s only when things are over that they make sense      whether this project will end up a play   film   or opera remains undecided    the thesis is simple enough that   if played right   it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone    instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes   the next scene no more engaging than the last    only once does any character utter something worthwhile   but by the time it happens you re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it    but don t fret   it will surface again    you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film   as some fellow critics did   and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in   not having missed anything worthwhile    but you hold hope for some time    the background music keeps you in a state of urgency   and even suspense   for the first few conversations    it s only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope    and with speeches like     i am thinking of something   but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else     how can you expect to hold anyone s interest    to godard s credit   he certainly knows how to frame a scene    the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful    watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him    and if this film had anything poignant to say   you would have   which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities    the environments   be it city or country   are impeccably captured in crisp detail   but the script never complements them    unfortunately   godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene    sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings   but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words    the second half is composed of nauseating hyper color that often blurs the image    you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners    the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies    steven spielberg is picked on in particular    while i ll grant that this does happen   and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage   it s still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood    it just goes to show   an intelligent person isn t necessarily an admirable storyteller    the days of breathless are no more    
Neg, america loves convenience    after all   we re the culture that invented the cell phone   the 24 hour atm   and my most beloved   the remote control    yet perhaps this time   with ghosts of mars   we have taken our love of convenience to far    ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails   pill poppin    martian cop   sent with her squadron to retrieve   demolition   williams   ice cube   from a remote mining town for trial back home    when she and her comrades   appropriately dubbed   the commander       the rookies     and the guy with the cool accent discover the town s residents slaughtered   they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents  head chopping   alien possessed clutches    filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks   flashes sideways   and viewpoint changes   ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill conceived action sequences    the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story    ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie   ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next   stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose    attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced    most of these moments come off as kwik e mart wisdom   dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even tempered streetwise hand of ice cube    with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other   cube reminisces about his street life   comparing the zombie stomping fun to   me and my brother when we was kids      apparently   crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment    but   even in the film s darkest moments   fate conveniently lends a hand   supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite    yes   in the future   man may travel to space and conquer mars   but nothing beats a good stick of tnt    and as we all know   every police station   past   present   or future   keeps a healthy supply on hand    characters die   heads are lopped off   but they were only supporting roles anyway   so why should we care    as long as you have plenty of narcotics   immunity is guaranteed    eventually though   even the most well trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson    what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation   killing anything the machine guns can t handle    explosions are fun    and even if the nukes don t get them   the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will    in the end this film defines itself when our cop s tribunal pronounces     is that all you have to tell us      for   indeed   john carpenter has run out of things to say   and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story    
Neg, reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger   scream 3 and arlington rd are the others   each derivative in their own special way      the guy can t seem to write believable dialogue   sample from reindeer games     rule #1   never put a car thief behind the wheel       create multi faceted characters   or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns   no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely      his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight    i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard     oh you thought my movie was gonna go here   f * ck you jack ass   take that twist   decipher this mother f * cker !    it s almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie    and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is    auteur theory be damned   it s kruger s   style     not the director s that winds up on screen    kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut   sometimes less is more      and his numerous twists can t even claim to be originals   arlington rd s ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j   pakula thriller the parallax view   and in reindeer games we get this ol  gem   character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn t know   pronouns used to protect the gender of the   character         grammar  be damned         how did you know that      the stunned protagonist asks   suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along            since twist endings are currently so in vogue   and seeing as how kruger s screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending   i guess it s no wonder why he works so frequently    he s quickly becoming miramax s mickey mouse   the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects    this is appropriate considering that miramax   which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films   has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports   life is beautiful   and freddie prinze jr   vehicles    their company s current logo could be   we ride the trends      reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy   a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head    although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness   he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick    affleck is such a puppy dog that it s impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone s bitch    the role itself is so badly written   the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it     the twists so outrageous   and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent   serious   movie getting    it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction   casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy   who s played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance    james frain is nick   rudy s cellmate   a manslaughterer who s found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason   charlize theron      ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she s never seen one picture of him    which works out fine since the character is killed in a near riot   and rudy   who was to be paroled on the same day as nick   takes his place   which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy   so frenzied it kinda looks like rape   and a surprise visit from ashley s brother   gabriel   gary sinise     who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co horts    he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who   according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley   used to work as a guard in the indian casino    though by the end   the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i ve described might as well be irrelevant    this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on   several scenes in which   after catching his prey   the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one liner    included   two   2   scenes of two   2   different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him   one following the other no less      though it s an action film   the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on   incredulous as the audience    the flick was directed by john frankenheimer   a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career   fell off the a list following a string of flops and now   in his old age   is slowly climbing his way back up    it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin   one of those almost but not quite movies   which followed the island of dr   morneau     you remember   the one with marlon brando in mime make up and a not so flattering moo moo     and now this    he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain zapped mtv audience to pick apart    problem is these action scenes   nearly all failed escapes   serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play    character problems abound   rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre   the latter of which is not   at least at this point   something ben affleck is capable of pulling off    the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear    but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster    charlize theron   an extraordinary talent   is   like affleck   playing whatever part the script requires her to play   whether it be vulnerability at one moment   anger at the next    she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes   frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this    gary sinise has played this role frequently   and here   as in snake eyes   he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol   the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more     that it becomes more of an annoyance   oh there he goes again         than a threat    these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience    
Neg, a follow up to disney s live action   101 dalmatians   that s better   more entertaining than the first    just as unlikely    with   102 dalmatians     the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs   more is definitely * not * the merrier    1996 s   101 dalmatians   certainly wasn t the greatest movie going experience of all time   but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous   larger than life performance    in addition   we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson   and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies    this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen   and close s facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53 year old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers    but that s only half the problem with kevin lima s laborious film    what makes   102 dalmatians   such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor   here almost single handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he s a dog   voiced by eric idle     its rabid plotlessness   cruella goes after puppies again   winds up in goo again   and most of all   the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic   heroes   of the piece   a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander than bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo      gruffudd is cute and harmless   perhaps   but evans can t even aspire to that    the dogs upstage them both   of course   but in the case of evans   even close s split ends are more animated    bad acting   however   seems to be a requirement for this sequel   since g   rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro s in   men of honor      jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu s over the top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail   and wail for wail    france s most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself   and in   102 dalmatians   the producers milk that realization for all it s worth  le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as   poopies     par example   and ad nauseum      the finesses of the script   attributed to four screenwriters no less   and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up   are quickly dispensed with   since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben          that done   it s back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown    the dogs are pretty cute  try making a puppy look otherwise  but that s pretty much all they are    there s always the feeling that there s a trainer off in the wings   coaxing the dogs to open doors   or pick up their food bowls in unison   or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder    savvy holiday goers should skip   102 dalmatians   and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead    it s one dalmatian less   but 101% more satisfying    
Neg, one sided   doom and gloom   documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible    orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he   along with best selling author hal lindsey   discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent   well for 1976 anyway   events    the film is dated badly   as many things that are supposed to happen in the   future   never do    for example   the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth    we re still here    the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick off the apocalypse    we re still here    some of the more ludicrous moments come when it s alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist   !      also   there s ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like    if it s anything like it s depicted as here then it s going to be incredibly boring    the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video    it contains the film in standard form   aspect ratio of 1   33   1     although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed    also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey   as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release   chariots of the gods    audio is mono dolby digital   and the video is fair to good for a film like this    i believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me    certainly i never expected a remastered print    curiously   the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case    but they re menu screens        so who really cares    [pg]  
Neg, play it to the bone   the newest addition to ron shelton s sports   themed repertoire fails in numerous ways    like most of shelton s other great films   bull durham   white men can t jump     this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots    shelton s films are not considered sports films   but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story    shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions    play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull   but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse    the film has no social message like its predecessors    the relationship between the friends   two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars   is very confusing for a number of reasons    the whole film   since it is primarily a   buddy picture     depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other    unfortunately   it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below    1   we never see how cesar   antonio banderas   and vince   woody harrelson   meet    the two are so different from each other   that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory    2   vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas    there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something    3   the third character on the trip   grace   lolita davidovich   stands in the way    she is in nearly every scene with them   making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other    4   there are two many interfering   irrelevant side stories    vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis   cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry   and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner    these boring tales only hurt the central plot    5   when it comes to time for the two men to fight   they don t even hesitate to pound each other    wasn t the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other    by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with   the film wants to be over    shelton   on the other hand   continues to tell his story    forty five painful minutes remain    the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies    however   the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile   kind of like the whole film    
Neg, some movies i should just skip    my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back   and here comes another disney effects filled live action flick based on an old tv program    true   the probgram is only 15 years old this time   and it s a cartoon    but it s a cartoon i liked   and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen    but my daughter really wanted to go   and how bad could it be    turns out i was right   mostly    inspector gadget   oddly enough   follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian   down to the jive talking side kick    at first i thought it was done by the same people   but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin   where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver    this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it   where   formula   isn t just business   it s a way of life    the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits    in some parts you can just hear them saying   more zany !  i want more zany here    and    here         let s have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here    make it really painful    i want the audience squirming in their seats         ok   that s fine   but i want you to add bug guts         what does this scene do    character depth    but where s the zaniness    i don t see zany here    if you can t make it zany   cut it !    the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie    michelle   who plays penny   gadget s niece   shines in every scene she s in   but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time    my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor    dabney coleman s comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby    i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film   but instead   he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes    he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the   gidget bitch from hell   town mayor    oteri s overly enthusiastic and continually self congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland   oregon s own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn t poking fun at our fair town    or   maybe all career politicians are like that    i must say   matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla    he appears to have some fun with the film   especially as the evil gadget    rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw    joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself    her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film    d   l   hughley plays the shuckin  and jivin  vehicular side kick   in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years    the dialog is       let s face it   it s pretty bad    the tag line after a major set piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context    a lot of the lines   especially hughley s   appear to be made up as they go along   by people with little gift for ad lib    about three quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw    gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations   not really   battles     with the evil gadget    penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon    let me rage here just for a minute    michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character    she s utterly charming   and has excellent experience   harriet the spy   for the part of the pint size detective    why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery    the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting   or editing   stupidity    inspector gadget is missing the long   long stretches of potty humor that   among other things   made my favorite martian so unbearable   but it s a very short movie   so perhaps something was cut at the last moment    probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits    the   evil sidekick support group   is especially worth seeing   and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it s onscreen    all in all   another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films    i wonder if disney uses the revenues for it s generally money making cartoons to produce these losers    but if true   why    if they re trying for another mary poppins   they need to find a team that can produce one   and then give them a chance to do it    
Neg, hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell    the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films    in a nutshell   the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous    with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership   a lot of hong kong s best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u   s   productions    such talents as jackie chan   rush hour     chow yun fat   anna & the king   the corrupter   and yuen woo ping   the matrix   have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results    now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai    unfortunately   romeo must die   bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong s rhythms    the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking    enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing   russell wong      kai confronts po sing   jon kit lee     the son of kai s boss and leader of the local chinese family    a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai   who handily kicks and punches his opponents down    it s not until club owner silk   rapper dmx     bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends    the following morning po sing is found dead    suspicions escalate   as issac o day   delroy lindo   is told of the murder    his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture    issac implores his chief of security   mac   issiah washington   to watch after his son and daughter    the scene shifts to a prison in china   where han sing   jet li   learns of his brothers murder    he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined    hung upside down by one foot   han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work    escaping to the u   s   han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother s death       romeo must die   is in many ways a fun film    it is both absurd and assured    the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes   the godfather      the relationship between jet li s han and aaliyah s trish o day reminds us of abel ferrera s   china girl     except that romeo must die s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another    their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history    the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable    li   of course has the showiest part   having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination    allayah   in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace    it s obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic    but   still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it    delro lindo as issac o day carries himself well in the film    an unsung and under appreciated actor   mr   lindo turns out the films best performance    the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d   b   woodside as issac s son   colin    the performance is undirected   with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in    an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written    first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film    having a career as one of the industry s best cinematographers   bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots   and   romeo must die   does look good    but the pacing of the film is lethargic   only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes    the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in    the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing    and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah s bodyguard   maurice has no comic timing whatsoever    the best things about the film are its fight scenes    jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles    one needs only to see his film   fist of legend   to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat    here   jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that   lethal weapon 4     jet s u   s   debut   didn t allow    unfortunately   a lot of jet s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision    also   romeo must die   must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film   and that is an x ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film   showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent    obviously a homage to the famed x ray scene from sonny chiba s   streetfighter     the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film    it s as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted    one problem though about the fight scenes    those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon    they do have an internal rhythm to them    a heartbeat   so to speak in their choreography    the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance    this is created by the performance   the direction and the editing    here in   romeo must die     there is no staccato    every fight scene   even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern    the rhythm is monotonous    a hong kong film has a tempo that changes   heightening its emotional impact     rmd  is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo   not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever    a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan s films      watch the restaurant fight from the film   rush hour   and notice that the context of the fight   while technically amazing is rather flat   the framing and cut always do not help      now look at the warehouse fight from   rumble in the bronx      there you have a heartbeat   and emotional draw that doesn t let the audience catch its breath    the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly   causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted    here in  romeo must die    the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl    jet li is a grand and personable screen presence    it s a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here    one day filmmakers here in the u   s   will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity    until

Neg, i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film    i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying     it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday   and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach    throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof !  we ll have a hit on our hands !    the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film   a mishmash collage of one dimensional characters   rampant stereotypes of cultures and races   cliched emotional statements of purpose   and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography    the story is loosely based around the pro football players  strike in 1987 and a rag tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels    keanu reeves stars as shane falco   a has been football college player looking for redemption    gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers    rounding out the cast includes swingers  jon favreau   7 up pitchman orlando jones   gruff owner jack warden   and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters   the drunken welshman   the overweight sumo wrestler   the black convict   the violent cop   and the dumb   dumb cheerleaders    this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays   gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is   keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field   and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny s    the usual things happen like clockwork    the hero rises from the ashes of failure   the team comes together in unity   the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest   the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap   and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax    it s also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks    howard deutch   who was behind the camera for two of the best films of  80s   pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful   has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes    obviously the problem is that without a good script   any director will fail in the end    sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory   gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds   the rise and fall of gallant heroes   and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life    the replacements offers none of this

Neg, among multitude of erotic thrillers   that had been released in the early 1990s   woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty   star of the b grade action films of the previous decade    those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star    as director   ginty did very little to improve that impression    the protagonist of the movie is jack   played by jeff fahey     yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford   played by bo derek      however   she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby   steven bauer      one stormy night   the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder    however   his good friend walter j   hill   robert mitchum   happens to be very good lawyer   so jack might even prove his innocence in the end    belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller   woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots    unfortunately   this film isn t comedy and any laugh is unintentional    the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them    the actors that play them don t help either    that is especially the case with jeff fahey   whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison    his partner bo derek   on the other hand   shows that she didn t age enough to cease being the sex goddess   but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents    ginty   on the other hand   tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting   but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer

Neg, capsule   where are you tonight   leni rienfenstal    starship troopers is an expensive   hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography    and bad pornography   at that    it is not good cinema   not good storytelling   and not even stupid fun   it s so cynically   calculatedly bone headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed    it s one of the worst movies i ve seen in a long time    why am i calling this movie pornography    pornography   in the abstract   is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts    i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie   where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper   as   a near pornographic eternity      i didn t agree with that assessment   but i could see what was being implied   the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout   do  er   man   do  er !    that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers    it s * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk    it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening    the film takes place in our future   when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn t appear to have intelligence    to counterattack   humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable   instead of nuke the planet from orbit   which they re clearly capable of   they send down grunts with m 16 rifles    this isn t heinlein   it s a bad wwii movie   one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy   repetitive   and ultimately tiresome       one scene has a journalist on a battlefield   filimg soldiers being slaughtered   and ends with groaning predictability   said cameraman gets skewered   too      the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic    they do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense    they don t even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie *   and therefore we don t care about them    we hated the tom berenger character in platoon   but he * mattered *   and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate    here   we don t even hate the bugs    what s there to hate    hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine    if there s anything really hateful there   the movie doesn t know how to give it to us    the screenwriter   ed neumeier    perhaps a better appelation would be   screen typist     and director   the increasingly talent impaired paul verhoeven   have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other    one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who s great at getting out of tight situations   and does it again and again and again    once or twice is fine    by the fifth or sixth time   it s worn out its welcome    there s never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything   or really being tested to show their mettle    also   the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry    if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp   then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing    but if one human gets cornered   he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip    uh huh    the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi fascist flavor    i say   quasi    because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action    the gear   the uniforms   etc      the movie doesn t have the nerve   or the brains   to be genuinely fascist   or intelligent about the subject    the bumpers between scenes   which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda    just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison    like the rest of the movie    there s more   i suppose   but it s not worth it    the acting is bland   neither arsenic nor gravy   the music disposable   the camerawork turgid    the heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece

Neg,    party camp     is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i ve seen in awhile    a late rip off of the   meatballs   series   the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk    that s really about all that can be said about the   plot   because nothing much happens   except that the main character   wise cracking jerry   andrew ross     has the hots for a cute blonde   kerry brennan     and there is a big contest in the climax    how fun !  since     party camp     has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved   the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative    it s not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality   but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this   the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex    even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick    at least   then   it wouldn t have been such a chore to sit through    never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat    the comedy was easy to spot   but it wasn t the least bit funny    it was groan inducing    constantly throghout   i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything    so what saves     party camp     from the dreaded zero star rating    well   that s simple   jewel shepard   as a flighty bimbo   was admittedly fun to watch    although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash   at least if the film had centered on shepard   she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid   low budget teen comedy

Neg, when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy   i expect negative reviews from critics left and right    predictable   unoriginal   and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you s and the drive me crazy s released by the dozens these last couple of years    what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i m sitting in the theater    am i enjoying myself    is this a comfortable break from my week of finals    this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks   i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i won t remember next week    so last week i opened up the new york times   and   no surprise   boys and girls got a negative review    daily news    negative    reelviews    negative    epinions   com    negative    this was nothing new    american pie   final destination   road trip didn t get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures    same goes for she s all that   a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded    since boys and girls reunites she s all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr     i predicted d   j   vu al over again    but   still curious   i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it   the reactions were far from positive    i had made up my mind   i ll catch it on video or cable in a couple of years    but   soon after   following a series of unexpected events   we couldn t get into shaft because it is rated r     i found myself watching boys and girls    whoops    boys and girls is about a   nerdy   smart   boy named ryan   prinze jr     and a   popular   flirt   girl named jennifer   claire forlani      briefly meeting as pre teens and now attending the same college   the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends    but in the movies   a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other    with advice from their roommates   amanda detmer   jason biggs     ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship    the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives   and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found    i could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons    the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie   mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to    it is almost offensive    an example of an insightful conversation       you re dumb    dumb   dumb   dumb   dumb         no         followed by a mandy moore esque tune background       well it s not as bad as wing commander i guess    the supporting cast is also painfully useless    detmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring   pointless subplots    and although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex   prinze jr s ryan dominates the screen while forlani s jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with    we never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character    teenager or not   you ll hate this movie   i guarantee it    maybe i should rent she s all that again    is it really as good as i think it is    
Neg, all through its production and into the early days of its initial   aborted pre release publicity   hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood    ultimately   however   paramount pictures   nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996 s other   underperforming disaster films   dante s peak   volcano     changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year    but   to paraphrase the bard   swill   by any other name   would smell as rank    no number of name changes can help this picture    it s not just about a disaster   it is a disaster    hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute    the best shot occurs during the opening credits   as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg   indiana as the water level slowly rises    the community   protected by an overworked dam   is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud choked skies    from that moment on   it s all downhill    whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point    it takes forever to get to the end credits    this is one of the longest seeming 95 minute motion pictures i have recently endured    basically   hard rain is one extended   dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot outs    there s a lot of water   broken glass   gunfire   and explosions    it s all very routine and uninteresting because there aren t any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense    the film s conclusion is so preposterous that it s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around    action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion    graham yost   the writer of both speed and hard rain   surely understands that principle    unfortunately   neither he   nor cinematographer turned director mikael salomon   a far off place     applies it    the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition    we see the same kinds of things    speedboat chases   flood damage   shoot outs   etc      over and over again    the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length    the storyline gives us a number of paper thin characters in contrived circumstances    there s tom   christian slater     the one  dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash    he and his partner   charlie   edward asner   tv s   lou grant       get stuck on a street that s rapidly turning into a river    a group of men   led by jimmy   morgan freeman     arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers    after charlie is killed in a shoot out   tom hides the money   then runs    as he swims and boats his way through huntingburg s roads   he encounters some of the locals   karen   minnie driver     a would be love interest   a bickering old couple   richard dysart and betty white     who are on hand to provide comic relief   and the easily corrupted sheriff   randy quaid     whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives    there isn t any real acting in this film    christian slater utters a few lame one liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera    tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen    randy quaid sneers a lot   and is totally unconvincing    morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances   but they are defeated by the script    freeman   one of the best cinematic thespians working today   looks suitably embarrassed to be here   but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time to time    following in the wake of twister   this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn t trust nature s fury as the chief engine of conflict    as a result   we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had    titanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water    hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible    thus far this year   hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire   firestorm   and water   hard rain      fortunately   there are only two elements left    
Neg, instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as   powerful   or   touching      i have a name for it myself     gross      this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully   the bully looks at the   rebel   threateningly   about to hurt him   and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too    how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me   aren t present day moviegoers beyond being   inspired   by something like that    this is one example   there are actually some more in instinct alone   of filmmakers insulting the audience s intelligence    instinct s plot is brimming with potential   world renowned anthropologist ethan powell   anthony hopkins   disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa    he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer   he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him    after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport   the authorities stick him in a prison s   psychotics ward      assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright   or so we are told   young psychiatrist theo caulder   cuba gooding jr        caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career    of course   and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way   he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison    and then there s the inevitable   heartless meanie   character   in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder s mentor    he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell    let s get one thing straight   dr   theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen   on screen or off    any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way    not good old theo    no   he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says   we need to talk about this right now      this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct s already dubious credibility   unfortunately it s also the least of its problems    director jon turteltaub   who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that   contrary to what this movie s promotion would have you believe   it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs    it s not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes   what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that   but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus   excuse the graphic depiction      it aims to   inspire   rather than to touch hearts    as yoda would say   inspire it does not    it is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter   the very experienced gerald di pego   has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie s story    indeed   somewhere in the beginning of instinct   one of the characters actually reads aloud the film s plot to another character    this   like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review   is a horrid insult to our intelligence    i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation    i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors   and he chews the scenery in this movie   brilliant as ever    oscar winner cuba gooding jr   on the other hand is dreadful    his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink    i liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling    i love animals   and instinct s prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with    however this movie s execution is completely unacceptable    tone down the violence and this will be a chick flick       1999 eugene novikov  
Neg, sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality    he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades   like twelve angry men   serpico or the verdict    but   in the same time   almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet s reputation    a stranger among us   1992 rip off of peter weir s witness   belongs to the latter category    the heroine of this movie is emily eden   melanie griffith     tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york    during one of such actions   her partner nick   jamey sheridan   got hurt and as a result   she becomes depressed    in order to help her recover   bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community    emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder    concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community   she decides to go undercover    that isn t easy   because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways    things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel   eric thal      using peter weir s formula isn t the greatest flaw of this film    even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent    but the worst insult to viewer s audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith    the author of this review never liked this actress very much   but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles    role of emily eden   unfortunately   isn t one of them    first of all   she can t pass for tough nypd street fighter   and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn t much better    screenplay by robert j   avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots   scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch      but   on the other hand   other actors are more convincing   lee richardson as an old rabbi   thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride     and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community    also   the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture    that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time    
Neg,    the world on land    it s just too big for me      starring tim roth   pruitt taylor vince   bill nunn   clarence williams iii    rated r    the legend of 1900s is the year s most absurd movie   a rambling   nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast    it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth   looking wistful as ever   as a guy named        1900    you heard right    his name is   in all actuality   1900    he was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900   uh   hence the name     abandoned and adopted by danny   a ship crewman    1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny s fear that he might be taken away from him because of   visa matters      well   when 1900 is about 9 or so   he starts wondering all around the ship    one day   he discovers a grand piano    he sits down and starts playing    miraculously   what comes out is beautiful    a group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age    when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is   totally against regulations   1900 replies   f * ck the regulations !    ho ho ho    1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land    when he s about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody s business   onboard comes another musician    his name is max   pruitt taylor vince   and he plays the trumpet    after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm   he sits him down on the piano next to him   takes the piano s braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall   taking them with it    how the chair they re sitting on and the piano don t separate   i don t know   but this apparently isn t the kind of thing we re supposed to ask    after that   1900 and max become friends    max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land   but 1900 has no intention of doing so    what s more   he doesn t even want his music to go anywhere without him   when a record company hears about his talents   they come on board to make a record of his music   but after finding out that    gasp !     they re going to make millions of copies   he breaks the record    the conflict of the movie is that after max   unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship   gets off himself   he stumbles upon a record of 1900 s music in a store    the record shouldn t exist because a   1900 never stepped on dry land and b   the one record that was made on the ship was broken    ladies and gentlemen   it s a mystery !  the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements    we re supposed to be roused by a climactic        piano duel    there isn t anything in this movie with the potential to compel    1900 comes off as a whiny   brooding   extremely unlikable man   i can t recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo  meditation on life    ditto for max   who doesn t seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900    tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf   there s no spirit   no gusto to the character    he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship   but to us he is dead    pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable   at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit    the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant   leering   king of jazz   who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel    the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore   whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many    this effort is utterly limp and lifeless    at once ridiculous   boring   narrow sighted and pointless   this is one movie that should be    and will be    quickly forgotten    
Neg, my giant is two movies for the price of one   but neither is worth the cost of admission   even if you get in free    as lamely directed by michael lehmann   the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book         without goliath   david is just some punk throwing rocks        languidly paced throughout   the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer   the omen   meanders toward its sad ending    since it s rarely funny or convincingly dramatic   what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery    other than a few nice visuals   there s nothing to recommend the picture    with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally   to the original city slickers   billy crystal has shown that he s more than the world s best oscar host    he does   however   have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year s father s day and this year s my giant    one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project    surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there    perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success    or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie s somber tone    the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day    this one joke movie s single idea is to place real life basketball player gheorghe muresan   who stands seven and a half feet tall   into as many visually striking situations as possible    sammy   crystal     an agent currently without clients   is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max   muresan      after throwing out constant one liners     either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car          sammy decides to get serious   seeing max as his meal ticket    and although he doesn t like it   he s willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half dozen dwarfs       the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever      after a series of missed opportunities   the comedic part of the movie is over   and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie    we learn that max s condition is terminal   and he will soon die    to be fair   the movie does contain a few good scenes   all of which you can see in the trailers    let s hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie    my giant runs too long even at just 1   37    it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up    my son jeffrey and his friend matthew   both 9   gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it    matthew pointed out that it   is not as good as it could have been or should have been         amen      he went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle    jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was    
Neg, talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters !  spice world is the feature film debut of the pre fabricated pop band   the spice girls    it s intended as a sort of hard day s night   but ends up simply hard to watch    when watching the spice girls   i m reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick   such as from the smurfs   the snorks   or teenage mutant ninja turtles   in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name    the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles   and about as talented    there s ginger   geri halliwell     the brainy one   sporty   melanie chisholm     the athletic one   baby   emma bunton     the childish one   posh   victoria adams     the fashion conscious one   and scary   melanie brown     the one with a tongue pierced back so far you re almost certain the post sticks out her throat    the film itself doesn t really have a plot    it follows the girls as they travel here and there   culminating at their   first live performance   at albert hall    the action   however   seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas    the various misfires include   an alien encounter   a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls   the shooting of a spice girls documentary   a movie producer   george wendt   trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie   nearly all of which   though incredibly far fetched   seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up     a meeting with a pregnant friend   whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends     a boating adventure   a bus race   club hopping   wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd       even  when they start to sing     and an assorted number of musical performances   press conferences   and general all around celebrity stuff    whew    for some reason   the film is littered with star cameos    from elton john to elvis costello   from bob hoskins to meat loaf    heck   even roger moore shows up   though he can t decide if he s parodying himself as james bond   or if he s lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld    richard e   grant has the largest secondary part   a thankless role of the band s manager   clifford    the celebrity spotting is partially amusing   and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film    neither amusing or spontaneous   when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring    their songs are alright   but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos    my advice to fans is   stay home and watch that video collection   or at least spin that cd a couple of more times       either  option will be more enjoyable than the film    non fans should know to stay well away from this one    
Neg, this feature is like a double header   two sets of clich   s for the price of one    not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts   but the banal rich girl poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure    an original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance    the screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins   based on a story by falls   merely lobs its plotline at the audience    this is a story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching    summer catch centers around ryan dunne   freddie prinze jr       a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league   supposedly a showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country    ryan is a blue collar kind of guy    he works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cod s rich and famous    he also   as we are informed early   his own worst enemy    he has the potential and the talent   but always seems to self destruct at the crucial moment    so   ryan tries to remained focused on baseball    then he meets tenley parrish   jessica biel     daughter of one of the blue bloods whose lawn he manicures    tenley   a name only a hack screenwriter could invent   is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan    if you can t figure out where all this nonsense leads   then you need a remedial course in film viewing    as always prinze is pretty to look at   but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions   puppy dog love   heartbreak   frustration   self loathing or determination    biel cries a lot   while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class conscious father    the only beacon is matthew lillard s fun loving billy brubaker   the team s catcher    summer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies   such as bull durham and the natural    no curve balls here   no sliders    every pitch is predictable    a blind umpire could call this movie    summer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking    it has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn    
Neg, one of the responses those that enjoy   detroit rock city     probably kiss fans   mostly   might have upon first glance at the rating i ve given the film might be something like     oh   that casey s gone and become a jaded critic on us    just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n  roll movie like this      i m wondering the same thing    i feel like i should have had a grand time with   detroit rock city      it s the sort of movie i wish i could ve had a lot of fun with   but i didn t    i just didn t    surely this film isn t trying to win any major awards   so should i have expected an oscar caliber film    no   but i expected something    a funny joke    a clever prank    a plot development    anything    the movie never delivers    you ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing       detroit rock city   is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film s existence   and it s not a very satisfying realization    the film is about four teenage boys   all huge kiss fans from cleveland   trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit   michigan    that s it    there is no big plot description in this review   because the movie has very little plot    the characters are hawk   edward furlong     lex   giuseppe andrews     trip   james debello     and jam   sam huntington      they have a garage band    they re pathetic   like all garage bands   but they like kiss and they like rock n  roll   so i guess that means we root for them    they have tickets   they lose them    they get more tickets   they lose those too    they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets   most of which backfire    there s not much more to it    frankly   it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film   when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys  hands   only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity    oh   and jam   real name jeremiah   has a really   really annoying ultra religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency    she doesn t want them to see kiss   if you hadn t figured that out already    it s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this    we ve got plenty of kiss   along with some ac/dc   ramones   and thin lizzy    then again     maximum overdrive   had an awesome soundtrack   me being the big ac/dc fan that i am     but is probably one of the worst movies of all time       detroit rock city   doesn t quite reach that level of ineptitude   but it gets dangerously close    in fact   the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind    basically   the soundtrack has earned the film a full half star   which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back   except for marilyn manson   whose half hearted cover of ac/dc s   highway to hell   sounds like something my neighbor s cat coughed up      it s also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste   because it  s evident that they re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie    edward furlong has done far better work than this   and so has natasha lyonne   and so has lin shaye   but hey   they ve got to make a living in hollywood    people wanting to see kiss   and lots of it will probably be disappointed   considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song    too bad   they might have provided some energy to this mess    director adam rifkin knows he hasn t got much material to work with   so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning    we get an endless parade of quick cuts   split screens   zoom outs   zoom ins   and rotating cameras   all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script    it s fun for a while   but eventually it becomes disorienting    i would recommend that those who felt seasick at   the blair witch project   stay far away from   detroit rock city     because the witch has got nothing on this baby    i haven t felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since   armageddon      and what about that script    it s written by carl j   dupr     which sounds like as made up a name as i ve ever heard    if it is   i can t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible    a plotless   pointless rock n  roll movie can be fun   if the jokes and gags are actually funny    the jokes in   detroit rock city   rarely are    in fact   the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana laced pizza   and that was just because it was so surreal    the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it   comedy      there is no set up   just a succession of punchlines that don t provide for much in the way of chuckles   precisely because there was no set up    it s as if they just whacked someone on the head   pointed at him and said     see    funny !    look   that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink    see    funny !  look   that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver    twice    see    funny !  look   that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money    see    funny !  a word of advice to mr   dupr     no   these things aren t funny all by themselves    they must be preceded by a clever set up so the audience hasn  t predicted them five minutes in advance    that s it   i ve said enough about this movie    it s a waste of time and money    i liked the music   but don t bother buying the soundtrack    i hear it  s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie    you want to see this concept executed well    go rent roger corman s 1979 classic   rock n  roll high school      it features another late seventies rock band   the ramones   and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show    yes   go rent that   and skip   detroit rock city     which will probably bomb   and deservedly so    
Neg, has it really been two decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears    nineteen years and two mighty ducks later   the formula is still going strong    police academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as a small town deputy sheriff corralled into co coaching the school s hastily formed soccer team    his partner in crime is the new british   exchange teacher     olivia d abo     a lively lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds and knows that the best way to gain the respect of a disinterested   outer city audience is to teach them something neat    like soccer    most of the good natured gags are of the fast motion variety   such as runaway cows and out of control lawnmowers    kids will laugh at the occasional belching bit   while their parents peacefully doze beside them    other than letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed   what s missing from the big green is a better integration of music and comedy    instead of a peppy pop score   which would arguably work to better effect   most of the action is set to a bombastic orchestral score that belongs somewhere else    comedy needs music    just watch any old bugs bunny short    the marx brothers knew it    mel brooks knows it    unfortunately   the current trend is to   overscore      lush strings and booming brass in every scene   at every moment    remember the simple strains of bizet s   habanera   in the original bad news bears    these days   it s usually a bellowing fanfare that threatens to smother every scene in its path    much like adding frosting to already frosted cake    an awfully big adventure ========================  the reteaming of director mike newell and star hugh grant is about as far removed as you can get from the lightsome comedy of four weddings and a funeral    their second collaboration is a downbeat theatrical drama about a young intern   georgina cates   struggling to survive in post w   w   ii  liverpool    hugh plays the gay director   an * extremely * unappealing character who may alienate whatever fans are left after the nonsense of nine months    bleak make up and thick accents conspire to make this a difficult story to settle into    an awful adventure is not without * some * rewards   tho    the peter pan subtext is intriguing    as is the diverse ensemble cast that includes peter firth   alan rickman   and prunella scales    basil !  devil in a blue dress =====================  the comparisons to chinatown are easy enough   except for the fact that this film isn t nearly as gripping    writer/director carl franklin   one false move   is the force behind this accomplished but stiff adaptation of walter mosley s crime novel    denzel washington is as sturdy as ever   but he s burdened with a miscast supporting cast    tom sizemore and scene stealer don cheadle are both fine    the problems start with jennifer beales   who never registers as the plot s femme fatale    she s a pretty face and nothing more    also underweight are maury chaykin and terry kinney    they play opposing mayoral candidates in 1948 los angeles and neither actor commands enough authority to stifle giggles    john huston   we miss you !  fine period detail and a strong sense of humor are a plus    they help to overcome a pace that s too polite for mosley s jazzy   swingin  story    steal big   steal little =======================  i can t say much about this one    director andrew davis follows the fugitive with a wildly unfunny farce about twin brothers   andy garcia   with opposing moral codes    they re fighting over their adoptive mother s estate   a 40   000 acre ranch worth millions and supporting dozens of migrant farm workers    so many different plots are trying to come together  feuding brothers   reconciling husbands   loan shark hired hitmen  that you have to admire the director s ambition    too bad that almost every single person or plot line is out of sync    that is   with the exception of alan arkin    he s the best thing in a movie that  despite the work of four credited writers   * still * manages to waste such diverse talents as david odgen stiers   kevin mccarthy   and joe pantolinao    and what the heck does that title mean    
Neg, funny how your expectations can be defeated   and not in good ways    the ghost and the darkness promised   at least   it seemed to me to promise   a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature    what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000 level material    an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters       get new jobs !    was one line   if i remember correctly    at the end of the 19th century   col   patterson   val kilmer   whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr   is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda    he is having immensely stereotypical problems   the natives are restless   his boss is a jerk   and now two man eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off    patterson tries to handle the situation himself   incompetently   and then turns to charles remington   michael douglas     a hunter of world reknown   or something like that      the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions   they should have gotten top billing and co starred with siegfried and roy    they are nigh invulnerable   as one comic book put it   and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature    give me a break    the movie hasn t got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas   it s just trying to find convenient ways to stall us    even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic    get this   remington s big plan is to build a large scaffold like structure in the middle of the savannah   sit on it   and wait for the lion to show up    he does this   and then gets knocked off by a bird    by the end of the movie   the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand    the acting is forgettable    douglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow   but it s nothing he hasn t done before    kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else   somewhere else   and the rest vanish into the cinematography    the camera   by the way   sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent    what did i expect from this movie    i dunno    some real excitement   i suppose    a sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation    no such luck    i dug out my tattered copy of hemingway s   the short happy life of francis macomber   and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind    
Neg, unfortunately it doesn t get much more formulaic than one tough cop    there s the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain    the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys   the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film    bo dietl   pronounced deedle   baldwin   is one tough cop   a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia    on top of that problem   he has a drunk   gambling addicted partner   penn   who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets   i guess cops aren t immune        then   throw into the mix the femme fatale   gershon      right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama    but right in the middle of the film   they throw in a completely un related plot point    dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from    the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death    once the case is solved   the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue    whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably    aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso   an insult if you ask me   the performances were pretty good    baldwin   though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec   does a fine job as one tough cop    penn   who also slips into an impression of his brother sean   is even better as a loser tough guy cop    what one tough cop lacks is originality    this film offers nothing new    nothing that you can t get from any cop film    it screams sidney lumet all over the place   perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman   producers of lumet s dog day afternoon and serpico    but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film    too much else is lacking    i also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture   something that i almost never notice    but once i saw that   i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot    at times   i was hoping to see it    one tough cop isn t laughable   nor is it a terrible film   but it just isn t unique    it is a classic example of a film that didn t need to be made    but one thing is for sure   it could really use a better title    
Neg, supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898    john patterson   val kilmer     the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation   tried to rid his operation of the lions   but fails    a world renound hunter   remington   michael douglas     is called in and the battle   man against lion   begins    this film has a great soundtrack   and wonderful scenery    the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin    we only see one side of each character    kilmer is a bridge builder and that s all we see him as    these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesn t even appear to be too upset about it    and the plot    it s jaws   but with lions    again we re presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should    it appears to kill men because it just likes too    why    who knows    i guess there wouldn t be much of a story if it didn t    the problem is that there isn t much of a story even though it does    
Neg, of course i knew this going in    why is it that whenever a tv star makes a movie it s always a romantic comedy   and then they say on entertainment tonight or something   that they were   attracted to the characters    they were really original      original   ! let me give you a run through of picture perfect   character a   kate   jennifer aniston   from tv s friends     a smart   beautiful   professional woman wants two things she can t have   a new job title and the love of her co worker kevin bacon    her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar   and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls    what does she do    she invents a fiance !  then when everyone wants to meet him   she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner   and pick a fight with her at the end   thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job   since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor   defenceless female    he   of course   goes along with it    gee   i wonder if they get together in the end    i ve seen more original stuff on the wb    and better stuff too    picture perfect also makes the mistake of being  wayyyyy  too long at 100 minutes   and expecting us to like aniston s character   who comes off as a cold   spoiled bitch

Neg, one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles    he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish   and one of his best was his last film   lone star    after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us mexico border   expectation ran high for his next film    unfortunately   his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for    we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do    then the film does exactly what it promised   a painful as that is    the plot of men with guns can be summarized   in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas    dr   fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went    and he found out again and again and again      of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell    a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians    but the film talks down to the viewer    dr   fuentes   played by federico luppi   teaches medicine in the capital city of his country    he has   as a great humanitarian gesture   trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios    fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service    then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy    in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others    the student tells him the others are still in the mountains   but suggests that it may not be a good place to be    fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors   ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general    the results are little different than one would expect    dr   fuentes starts out incredibly naive    even some american tourists   present in the film mostly for comic relief   seem to know better than dr   fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains    but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was    sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians    the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences    federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos    damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter    mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer

different    if you ve worked yourself silly for months   relax a bit    sleep in    eat pancakes at noon    microwave an egg in its shell    watch pro wrestling with the sound off    listen to some barry white records at high speed    whatever    but do not   under any circumstances   spend your vacation doing the same thing you do for a living    and   if you do   don t make the final product look ten times worse than it would any other time    because i do not want to hear your sob stories   oliver stone    you apparently thought you needed a break from making   important films      cool    so you found this hinky little book and decided to make it a movie    that s cool   too    but   ollie   old sage   do not take a good story and a hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade    i m just eager to meet you one day   so i can buy you a stoli   look you in the eye and say     what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with u turn      and i ll stand there staring  til i get a straight answer    sean penn stars u turn   as bobby   a drifter who s had some troubles a while back    he s heading cross the desert minus two fingers when his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose   stranding him in superior   arizona   held there by an   ignorant   inbred   turtleneck hick   of a mechanic named darrell    while darrell puts a new hose on the ride   bobby walks into town to see what s cooking    is it needless of me to say that superior   arizona   is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely    probably not    bobby meets up with grace   jennifer lopez     who invites him back to her place   for drape hanging and other domestic issues    just as those issues are starting up   grace s husband   jake   storms in   looking like check out day of the elks lodge convention    just beats bobby silly    bobby takes to the road   only to meet up with jake again   and jake asks bobby to kill grace    a little while later   grace asks bobby to kill jake    them murderous arizonians    gotta love  em    if any of this sounds familiar   congratulations    you win a kewpie doll    the story is a straight shoplift of red rock west   a cult favorite a few years back from john dahl   maker of the phenomenal the last seduction    but the contest doesn t end there   guys and gals    we get steals from russ meyer movies   where everybody in town is horny and sweaty    we get the town from bad day at black rock   minus the train   plus busty women who can speak    look at any schwarzenegger film   and you ll see our hero   bobby   as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times   has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times   gets bit by a tarantula   gets shot at   and ends up with vultures circling overhead   all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick    bobby as terminator    stretch it a bit   and we have a five finger discount from doc hollywood   where the whole story occurs because of car trouble   forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic    okay   he s working from a book   so maybe ollie s not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas    i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative    i just wish he hadn t brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe stub    sean penn gives a great performance   and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be   playing over the top caricatures of stereotype characters    the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety blank is going on    too bad it s not fun to watch when it s happening to us       while  we sit through this mess of a film    u turn is not a bad film if you re a fan of technique    it s the oliver stone you ve always known    robert richardson is his usual cinematographer   and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick    great camera angles   shifting viewpoints   wicked colors   nice looking pictures    but pictures of what    i think i d rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt o whirl point of this loser film    plot twists are one thing   repetition is almost unforgivable   and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie i ve seen in the past five years    oliver   i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at    you ve been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie   and films like platoon   jfk   wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on    your scripts are certainly respectable   your budgets are up there on the screen   and your actors don t dog it    and i know that   maybe   with u turn   you were just kicking back   just having fun    that s fine    but don t do that with a movie with the potential of this one    do some police academy sequel   imagine that      do a big comedy   like a remake of it s a mad   mad   mad   mad world    but do not drop a limp u turn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as   an oliver stone movie     and not question why it stinks like week old snook    there s a right way to have fun   and a wrong way to have fun    this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail    
Neg, there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs    one is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film    two is never greenlight a sci fi film starring john travolta    to wit   we present the disaster that is battlefield earth    a science fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild   battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum security prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior    sci fi is always a tricky beast   tight script   a good director   an ensemble cast of decent actors   and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs    battlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes    here s the `plot      the year is 3000    mankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos   sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group      a small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons  who dwell in the cities below    the psychlos are strip mining the earth for its resources and terel   played by travolta   is the head of security for the mining/slave base located in denver    a young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler   played with dramatic flair by barry pepper   ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons      he is promptly captured and taken to the alien base    after several attempts at escape   johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel s   involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end    jonnie   assumed leader of the mining slave group   then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use    then the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry   the bill of rights   how to use a machine gun   and how to fly a harrier jet    the whole mess concludes with a big   loud   obnoxious gun and plane battle that had me praying for the end credits    roger christian   the director of this lumbering beast   must have rented dune   blade runner   planet of the apes   independence day   stargate   beastmaster   the airwolf episodes   the `v  miniseries   the matrix   and the omega man        and decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth    christian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie !  and every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe    really    the psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit    travolta s acting hasn t been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect    jonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like `you can have your freedom if you fight !    then there s the script   the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet  would be a difficult task to achieve    why    because terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt    for no particular reason beside the fact that `humans are stupid      terel may be right   you know    humans made this movie    
Neg, would you believe    in real life   i mean    that if you were julia roberts   that you d be the ugly underdog to your sister   the creepy catherine zeta jones    let me tell you what reality is    reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts   and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot    that s reality    america s sweethearts is the opposite of reality   a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also ran   presumably because she wears horn rimmed glasses and used to be overweight   uh huh      the plot follows two married   mega movie stars   gwen and eddie   zeta jones and poor   poor john cusack   whose material gets worse every year     on the eve of their new star vehicle s release   a film called time over time    the only problem   gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation   and the press and public have not been forgiving   think meg and dennis      gosh   and the director has vanished with the film   holding the only print hostage    veteran pr agent lee   billy crystal   is called upon to clean up the mess   throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie   presumably distracting the stupid   stupid film critics into forgetting they haven t seen the movie at all       note to sony   any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab      and did i mention gwen s sister kiki   roberts   is along for the ride    and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way    oh billy   you re a scamp !  the script you ve co written with peter tolan   what planet are you from    and bedazzled    need i say more     is a roast of hollywood and celebrity   sure   but it s not a funny one    yes   crystal tells us   hollywood is lying to our faces !  if you are surprised by this   you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine    it s about to expire    aside from a scant few zingers   yeah   se   or winces rules !      america s sweethearts  jokes aren t funny   its pace is choppy   and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project    not for headlining star julia roberts    but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself    i didn t time it   the movie s not that bad     but it s crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film    bad move   billy    your jokes suck    the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie s gags    and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene   how this movie earned a pg 13 rating is a mystery to me    julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend s wedding into a winning film   but not even that 90 tooth smile can save her here    obviously aware of the ugliness before him   director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria   as a lisping spaniard     christopher walken   the insane time over time director     and alan arkin   a new age guru in a fright wig   to crack wise    none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken   azaria comes off as a preening queen when he s supposed to be macho    as for roth   in case you don t know   went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio   revolution   which produced this work    he s back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years    it ll probably be another 11 before he s back again    i could drone on about how america s sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies   but that would get old    instead   i ll settle for discussing the movie s worst sin   that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable   not just in its plot but in its sentiment    every single character in this film   with the arguable exception of kiki   is simply hateful   and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains    when you leave the theater   you ll ask yourself   too   why would i want any of these jerks to be happy    
Neg, rated   r for strong violence   language   drug use   nudity   and some sexuality    starring   wesley snipes   anne archer   michael chaykin   donald sutherland   marie matiko    running time   117 minutes  directed by   christian duguay  i ve never fully understood wesley snipes s career    he has his ups and downs   but mostly the downs    his best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled   blade      he has had his typical action movies     boiling point       passenger 57     but his new movie   the art of war   should just be called   rising sun 2   the art of war   cause basically it s a semi remake of the same plot   with a different cast   and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller   that is high on style and low on substance    wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u   n   after a chinese ambassador is killed   he is on the track of the killer   trying to find out who it is   how it happened   where the killer was   and what to do    anne archer plays his   boss   type person of the u   n   and she has hired snipes to track down the killer    well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer   and is now an outlaw   kidnapping a chinese woman with him   and having her help him along the way    all this leads to a finale that is so dumb   and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb   and the stunts   dialogue and acting all ruin this movie    wesley snipes isn t one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before    the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998 s   blade      i walked into   the art of war   expecting a good   high octane thriller   and all i got was a pile of mush    the only real  good  thing the movie has is action   and plenty of it   but i noticed it is badly filmed   the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on    the ending finale is so worthless and pitiful   that it even tries to mock   the matrix     laughably funny   it is undeniably stupid    christian duguay s direction is also not that great    his camera angles and sense of style are all in place   but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done    even the whole   matrix   ending wasn t even good    the stunts and action are badly filmed   and badly choreographed    his placing of the characters   and the assination of the chinese ambassador   and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable   that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie    anne archer who is usually good in her roles   turns in a horrible job here    she is sour   downbeat   and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue   and dumb moves    even donald sutherland as a co star can t save this movie from being a bust    so for an overall opinion     the art of war   is a total waste of time    it s not entertaining   nor exciting   or even action packed    it is a pointless movie   and makes absolutely no sense at all    if you really want to see a good version of   the art of war     rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind   rising sun     it isn t a great film either   but at least it s better than this    
Neg, movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good   the bad   and the despicable    i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in  95   but i wanted to re write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics    we need to be warned about some truly awful films   too    this picture was so bad   it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating   see ratings chart below      the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno    so   it does indeed have some plusses        in fairness   elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff    and her ability to whine and irritate us   even while nude   was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone    this character is not smart   not interesting   and   deliberately      far too annoying far too often    like in 1998s   bulworth     when the movie was over i didn t care one little iota about the main character    at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film   though       showgirls   is too stupid to make a statement    some people claim that the story is based on the legendary   all about eve   of all things !  if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l   mankiewicz was   he d be       well    he d be a good screenwriter    instead   this project may have sunk his career    he wrote the   ha ha !    script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed    the same team who created a good sex film in 1992     basic instinct     struck out here with their occasional violence   gratuitous x rated sex scenes   and numerous   and quite unnecessary   lesbian overtones    the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer    after the supposed street smart young   lady   gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack jawed yokel in the opening sequence   she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the   stardust hotel      nomi doesn t take advantage of this contact to break into the big time of dirty dancing right away    first   she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club    she sells her hot little wares at   the cheetah   for a short time   turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience    hey   i never said she wasn t a hot number        maybe it s that   her body   which gets her into the big time when the star of the   stardust hotel     crystal connors   gina gershon   stops into the strip club   it certainly isn t her brains or pleasant disposition !      crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend   kyle maclachlan      he also happens to be the pleasure seeking worm who runs the big show    crystal gets nomi onto the   stardust   team and   after an interminable amount of time   nomi   earns   the role of crystal s understudy    the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal    it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she s   not a whore      that s a phrase we hear a few different times and it s completely ludicrous    of course she is !  she sells her soul to make it big   but in the end we re supposed to believe that she s a better person than that    we re supposed to root for her    no way !  she s a tramp and a back stabber who deserved nothing  least of all vindication in the       ahem       climax    she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is    the sub plot with a male dancer   glenn plummer   who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more    it sure ain t character development !  plummer also appeared in   speed   in  94 in a smaller   yet better role    this sub plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control    kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay day or his standards have dipped since appearing in   blue velvet      that picture was weird   but some critics claim it s one of the best movies of the  80s    now ol  kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the  90s   too    his sleazy character is important to   showgirls     but we don t learn anything about him    he uses people to get what he wants   but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie    is he a villain    who cares !  ultimately   this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit    everyone must know by now about the soft core acts of copulation   especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool    what few reviewers take issue with is how mean spirited this movie is    everyone s either having sex   exacting revenge   or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge    it s just too hard to take   especially for over two hours      if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world   why couldn t verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers   grunts   and other sounds during the dance numbers    it s hard to care about these people if we can t even appreciate what they re capable of doing on stage    berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body    after all   the world of porn is still an active   dishonourable profession    perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford    oops   they re bad actors   too    well   at least   they re not selfish and contemptable like good ol  slutty nomi malone    useless trivia  ironically   elizabeth berkley played virtuous and   holier than thou   jessie on the teeny bopper tv show     saved by the bell     before breaking onto the big screen    
Neg, mr   nice guy is the latest jackie chan film   so you should know what to expect    a weak plot   terrible dialogue   very little acting ability   but some jaw dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile    however   mr   nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie s best efforts   and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever    jackie chan plays   who else   jackie    this time out   he s a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show    not that it ever makes a difference in the plot    there are only two scenes of him cooking    for the rest of the film   somehow he mutates into jackie chan   supercop    it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills       perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege    a tv newswoman   diana   gabrielle fitzpatrick     covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo   richard norton   and a local gang of toughs   the demons    although she only has one camcorder   somehow the result is full of close ups and multiple angles       hmmm    shades of broadcast news        anyway   the goons discover diana   and will do anything to recover the tape    here lies another crucial flaw in the story   doesn t anyone realize you can copy a tape    oh well   no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense    as luck would have it   diana runs across jackie   and   wouldn t you know it   jackie accidentally ends up with the tape    this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie    in a move apparently designed to woo american   and other english speaking   audiences   the film uses english as its primary language    however   that doesn t mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie s recent americanized releases    strangely   many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english   and poorly too    whether this is just a very bad case of looping   an effort to minimize accents   or a simple case of nostalgia   it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie s dubbed films    the plot in mr   nice guy is negligible   merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons    but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie s films   it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread    look   if you have jackie chan playing a chef   why not use that to your advantage    watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen   beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts    the action is a mixed bag here    there s really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie s films    it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site   apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan    the action in the film is neither jackie s best nor worst   but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes    the film s gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting    once or twice   it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence    but to slo mo jackie running    either this is a nod to the six million dollar man   or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down    if you ve seen all of jackie s films and are in need of another fix   go ahead and see mr   nice guy    however   if you re just in the mood for some good action   you d be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work   such as supercop    
Neg,    first rule of fight club is   don t talk about fight club      this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film   because quite frankly   it s not even worth mentioning    director david fincher   seven   has completely gone over the edge    with crude humor   an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture   i m surprised i didn t walk out    this just goes to show that hype kills    it s very rare that a film so hyped up as   fight club   turns out to be noteworthy   and this is no exception    the story goes like this    edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions   until he meets marla   helena bonham carter      norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle   when he spots her at a session that he also attended    apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like   literally living in pain    why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me   but things do get worse    norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling   and it s on a plane that he meets tyler durden   brad pitt      the two men develop a bond   and go out to a bar   and by golly after they get drunk   the two pitiful characters fight    how do they come up with this stuff    anyway   their fighting catches other pathetic loser s attention   and a club is formed    out of all this mess   there manages to lie a message    fincher shows us that society is like robots    we work in our jobs doing things step by step   and want out    our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are   and we blame it on others    call me crazy   but this is common knowledge    i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is   which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably    even with two good actors   and a solid actress   they only manage to weaken the story    i couldn t help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp    it just shows how desperate the script is for attention    i guess brad pitt was right for this role   because i felt like beating him up myself    his bothersome and depressing character   made me disgusted at his 20 million fee    it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more    helena bonham carter however really had no purpose    she just popped up on screen   mumbled some lines   smoked and left    this continues for what seems like 6 hours    the film drags on and my headache gets bigger   while   fight club   nears what i think might be the end    unfortunately by then   the film hits rock bottom    though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes   it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace    on a side note   the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film   that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer    fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson    concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment   won t do any good if everything else is in need of support    also   i m afraid that immature men might respond to the film s violence    the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult    when the film ends   i m just glad to get home and take some advil    you ll either enjoy what the film has to offer   or agree with ed norton when he says   this is so f * * * ing stupid      
Neg, note to screenwriters and self   when you hit the big time   and the studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting in your bottom drawer   tell   em all to hit the road    gilligan wrote the arbitrarily titled home fries ten years ago   it was shelved until he found success as one of   the took a second look at gilligan s   comedy     they read it again wearing rose tinted glasses    drew stars as sally   a dim   but sweet     pregnant waitress at a small town burger joint located somewhere in the southern united states    the father of her child is dead   the victim of a severe heart attack brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons   these flyboys scared him with their low flying helicopter    dorian   wilson   and angus   busey   were getting even for his philandering ways on behalf of their anguished mother   o hara      trouble is   sally picked up some interference on her drive thru headset   and angus worries she may have heard conversations that took place in the helicopter prior to the accidental killing    so dorian goes undercover as a burger flipper   before you can say   with cheese   he falls for the mother to be    too bad mom and angus have homicidal plans for sally    does this sound like a movie you want to see    without a doubt   the best thing about home fries is barrymore   at the risk of sounding sexist   she s never looked better than here   as a curly redhead with twinkling eyes    she is winning in a role that requires her to do absolutely nothing except look apple cheek cute and gawk at wilson   her real life boyfriend    but the plot and the situations are so off putting that nothing could save it    this movie desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the coen brothers   but home fries  brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses like ethan and joel    it s raising arizona without babies   without charm   without laughs   without human characters   and without intelligence   worst of all   it s creepy    what s funny about threatening to gun down a pregnant woman with a machine gun       unless the woman in question is a spice girl      take out the helicopters   the quasi incestuous relationship between the mother and her sons   it is absolutely illogical   within the movie s framework   that dorian still lives with his mother and brother     and the scenes of murder   attempted and otherwise     and what are you left with    the story of a single woman with child who works at a fast food joint   but dreams of becoming a country singer      that could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made   but it d be better than home fries    
Neg, the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes   with everything ranging from   l   a   confidential   to   palmetto   to   the big lebowski     has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran   talented directors    with this particular genre   directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower class and the glamorous   opulent upper class   while maintaining the noirish   ambiguous ambience   the staple of film noir       wild things   could be classified as a black comedy   a sultry film noir or a plain ol  erotic thriller   but the one category it doesn t qualify for is that of a quality motion picture    overacted   overwrought and overlong     wild things   is a confused mess   a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too    with its incalculable twists   turns   more twists and more turns   it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness    in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon   who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal     wild things   not once jells in its eroticism   unpredictability   character motivation   sense of the world   plot   etc   there s not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical    directed by john mcnaughton     henry   portrait of a serial killer         wild things   follows sam lombardo   matt dillon     a hunkish   suburban florida high school teacher who s the dream of every spruced up female in the community    particularly one    kelly van ryan   denise richards   adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner    soon   her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike   enabling her to come into his house    next thing   she cries rape    and the so called   roller coaster ride   ensues    a second accuser comes front   suzie toller   neve campbell     a booze drinkin    tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her   virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions   asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen    even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo s zany lawyer    he wears a fake neck  brace   waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray    you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role    as ridiculous as it sounds   he s the most sane character in the movie    the community is astonished    reporters flee to the scene    there s an 8   5 million settlement for a libel suit against kelly s mother   theresa russell      there s the ambiguous cop   kevin bacon   who also executive produced   who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit   murder and lust    we   the audience   sniff something not so lustful    like so many thrillers these days   including   the usual suspects   and   the game       wild things   eschews character for plot    mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera   and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease   as if he knows the territory he s covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany   henry     a furious   unsettling film directorial tour  de force    george clinton s score is a delight to behold    but it s the humans    the characters are mere devices for the   nasty   twists    what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving   almost unbearable   if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting   don t feel real or we don t care for them    not even the unintentionally funny moments work    the people in   wild things   are not so much people as they are caricatures    then there s the erotic content   which nearly earned the film an nc 17   for a sexless   badly edited   poorly lit menage a trois    and in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country   kevin bacon s member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go    ironically   the wildest elements of   wild things   are not wild at all    
Neg, it rocks actually   lots of rocks fly at us or from us   in slow or fast motion   at several points in the film    they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward   and when they land once in a while   when we need a break from the space sequences they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like       nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur      they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon   a steroid user s answer to deep impact    bruce willis stars as harry stamper   a famed oil driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond   zero barrier   and destroys our planet    why an oil driller    they require someone experience with deep core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid       in one unintentionally        hilarious sequence   nasa asks harry to inspect a deep core driller they built based on his blueprints   it is poorly constructed harry criticizes almost every aspect of it    we trust nasa to build space shuttles      harry assembles the obligatory   ragtag   bunch of   cowboys     including a blond guy   a fat guy   a black guy   a wiseass   and the man who is sleeping with his daughter   affleck      once they reach space   we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it   i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes    whether or not they save the day   i will not reveal    nor will you care    i will say this   you know you re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope    willis has barely a chance to come alive   ditto for affleck    their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act   in a last minute and futile attempt to inject warmth into the material    steve buscemi s character the wiseass is exceptionally problematic       rockhound     as he s called   is sarcastic and foolish   so they tape him to a chair   where he spends most of the film    so why did they bring him up there to begin with    rather   why write him into the film    give  his almost witty one liners to serious willis   who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies   at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter   firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig    i m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel   at least in my world where the sky is blue    liv tyler is pretty and humourless   as always   suspiciously   four of her father s band s     aerosmith     songs grace the soundtrack    director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick   like ketchup   eventually drowning the movie on screen       the middle hour is a non sensical   pyrotechnic assault on the average primate s brain      whenever someone dies in this movie   a crew member inevitably yells out   we lost   insert dead person s last name here   !    i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil guy cum astronaut from a live one   and close ups of the corpses  faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance   as their skin was often covered in fake blood    armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla    it looks nicer   and has fewer plot holes within its equally ludicrous framework    it has a vivid soundmix    but at almost two and a half hours   i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story    the love story has been played up in the ads   perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic fever    bollocks !  the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon crawler    remember a little film called jaws    in this film   three independent minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark    they didn t much like each other at first   eventually   they started to respect one another    one of jaws  great scenes involved the would be ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories    this is the sort of male bonding foreign to bay or his producer   jerry bruckheimer   who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end    not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances i d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before   action   was called    a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don t bare their souls   who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest beating bravery    to this   i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic   nor brave   nor smart   even   this team couldn t build a birdhouse    and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer a trailer for a movie written by a team of body builders and greeting card authors i ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life    
Neg, there s a 1   000 foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact    i d say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies   which are getting more irwin allen  esque with every release    the early wave of this revival   while just as cheesy and laughable   at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes    deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama   with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking    the repeating cycle is as follows    the president   morgan freeman   will go on tv and tell the country that there s a remote chance a comet will strike the earth   but that the nation s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem    then we get to see the plan in action   in some sequence utterly lacking suspense    the mission will barely fail   and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth   and there s a remote chance it will strike   but that the nation s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem    it goes on and on throughout the movie   but every time freeman goes on tv   we know his plan is going to fail    how do we know this    because we ve seen the tv ads for deep impact   ads that feature freeman telling the nation that   the comet is still headed right for us   and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading    ladies and gentlemen   that is the movie    successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow   but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30 second tv spots    television is what s wrong with deep impact    the main character   played by tea leoni   is a low level broadcast journalist for msnbc   and that s the mere tip of the product placement iceberg   who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy    she thinks it s an instance of an ex secretary of something or other   james cromwell   resigning because of a mistress   and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area    when she goes nosing around cromwell   he begs her to keep it under wraps       i know you re just a reporter   but you used to be a human being      she figures out what s really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search   where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction  level comet    upon a top secret meeting with president freeman   leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference   at which she gets to ask the first question    and everyone knows   if you get to ask the first question   baby you re a star    leoni ends up in the anchor chair   broadcasting every step of the comet s collision course with earth    and i m sure it s comforting for her to know that   even though the world s ending in a matter of months   she s a cable news personality    so there she is   narrating the six astronaut mission to blow the comet up    such personalities as robert duvall   jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged out process    but as anyone who s seen the commercials knows   the astronauts fail    they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces   which means even more destruction to the earth    yeah   thanks   nasa    that s when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren t picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years    they even have animals   two by two   ready to climb into the cave    if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed   deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie    instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife   while people pack the highways out of town    the reasoning is   of course   that if a comet is going to strike   they might as well be out in some scenic rural location    and   amusingly   the highway is spotted with people in u haul trucks    i m sure it s comforting to know that   even though the world s ending in a matter of minutes   the u haul people are doing the most business of their lives    
Neg,    there will be another     the ads for this sequel proclaimed   and why not    true   brandon lee is dead   but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994 s the crow   anyway    the idea of spinning artist james o barr s original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie   taking its own righteous vengeance against the world    given that basic framework   the story could move in any number of directions    of course   it doesn t    stubbornly   the crow   city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film   when lee s eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death    i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality    in flashback   we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover   and then we watch in real time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind    it s loud and repetitive   true   a sadist s delight    but it s also horrifying and fascinating    city of angels gives us more of the same   but less skillfully    there s an audience guaranteed for a film like this   although bad reviews and poor word of mouth will likely ensure that it won t be much of a success    in fact   miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings       i ve never understood the reasoning behind this tactic   since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow      so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup    this time   ashe   french accented actor vincent perez   is retrieved from his watery death   he and his young son were shackled together   shot   and then thrown off a pier   by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead    perez might have some screen presence if he s given something to do with himself   but here he s simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face    at first   he s shivery and frightened   but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave    he s befriended by sarah   mia kirshner     presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film    kirshner   so beguiling in exotica   is here an exquisitely photographed blank    tattooed with angels  wings   sarah is just about as lovely as women come   but she serves no purpose   not even as seductress    the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah   richard brooks     but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop   who plays a gaunt fellow named curve    iggy   all bones   veins   and drawl   is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film    like all good things here   he s dispatched too soon and without much imagination    in the meantime   we re subjected to tedious glimpses of judah s compound   where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren t distinctly secondhand    even the soundtrack is tired    more than anything i ve seen from hollywood lately   city of angels smacks baldly of product    it s a movie with a lousy script but a great look    critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope   but his work isn t that bad per se    he s got a good eye   and some intriguing visual ideas    if anything   this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery    his major stylistic failing is that he can t seem to direct an action scene   and the quick   nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie    but as director   he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn t   the performers who couldn t   and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved    who bought david s   goyer s anemic script   anyway    the producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash   or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference    
Neg, late in down to you   the lead female character   julia stiles   states her greatest fear is having an   artificial conversation   with her boyfriend   freddie prinze jr        the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out   fallen asleep   or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy    the film is a multi million dollar testament to everything artificial    filled with characters   motivation   plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster    prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles  freshman co ed    at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out doing the previous in how   cute   it can be    the happy couple   psychoanalyze   each other   they pick out a song because   as prinze s dj mother   lucie arnez   explains   every couple needs a song   he smells her shampoo   she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love    then   in standard romantic comedy style   things fall apart    why    well   because they have to    otherwise the couple can t make up and live   presumably   happily ever after    down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic    scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism   but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead    a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre   not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together   or even knowing each other   but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat    the supporting characters are remarkably flat   and insultingly ridiculous as well    stiles  best friend   rosario dawson   is a pot head   prinze s roommate   shawn hatosy   is a girl crazy fool who can t meet women   and then there are the porn stars   zak orth and selma blair      he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television   does the college lecture circuit   and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film    you know   the average porn star    the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he s on screen   the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes    she is a porn star mostly so we know she s slutty   so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted    attempts at drama   which means julia is going to cry   include a pregnancy scare and the big break up    these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes    what happened here    the cast is full of likable   promising   young actors   stiles especially seems to be going places      writer/director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off    in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year s extremely unpleasant the story of us   for teen audiences    the direction is film school grad obvious    it s stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen   a pointless parody of   cops     characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters   and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion    plus   the whole story is told flashback style   narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera    this is the second film in a row   following wing commander   starring freddie prinze jr   which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she s all that    if he doesn t start making better choices fast his future films won t be so lucky    
Neg, for better or worse   the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated   oversexed   underwritten thrillers    apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn t change a thing   since body of evidence wasn t written by him   but has a puzzling eszterhas ish presence all over it    in other words   it s a   really dirty and b   really   really stupid    madonna   first warning sign   stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job   she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi naked   presumably for the edification of the shrimp    she s been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover    already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect    the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she s under thirty   or at least looks it     and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men    what s worse is that the movie confirms all the above   and wallows in them as well    madonna s character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition       and yes   there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy    this movie leave no scummy stone unturned      anyway   willem dafoe   very good but completely wasted   also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna s sexuality    how do we know this    because his character is set up with the token wife and kids    how obvious is it that he s gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up    and get kicked out of the house    and get welcomed back anyway    don t skip to the end yet   we re just getting warmed up    dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie    most of it is about as erotic as open heart surgery   since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax   always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don t know the first thing about * really * kinky sex   and smashed light bulbs    don t ask    another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story   it s insanely dull    what s worse is that body of evidence is dull * everywhere *   not just in the sex scenes    the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes    the thriller business itself is ridiculous    it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs   and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor    and the ending    another homage to eszterhas   maybe       is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact * frame * where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in    the director is uli edel   all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f   everyone has to eat   i guess   but this isn t a meal ticket   it s leftovers    
Neg, it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable    the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed    it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers   james horner    what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995    what drags braveheart down is its screenplay    it abounds with high production values   john toll s award winning cinematography   which also graced edward zwick s 1994 legends of the fall     a gorgeous score by horner   and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names    but this does not save a misguided script    the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero   but the viewer s only response to his   heroism   is intellectual   william wallace   producer director mel gibson   is fighting for freedom and against tyranny   so we have to root for him    but wallace s actions paint a different story    he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance    though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side   the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait   in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king    wallace speaks of freedom   but his acts point toward vengeance    after kicking the english out of scotland   he decides to invade england    this is evident of a   spartacus complex     and this example applies both historically and cinematically    the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities   the film spartacus   like braveheart   has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay    it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film    horner s score tries to make emotional connection   but the performances and the script do not help    gibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him    this drags down any emotional connection to the film s plot   and turns three hours into a total waste of time    
Neg, susan granger s review of   the watcher     universal    just what we need   another lurid   trashy serial killer saga    this time   keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking clock cat and mouse game with james spader   a burnt out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd    to taunt spader   who has relocated to chicago   reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too    before long   he starts mailing photographs of the lonely   unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims   challenging spader   along with the chicago police department   to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again    in the midst of this murderous frenzy   there s spader s psychologist   played by marisa tomei   who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in   the cell      writers david elliot   clay ayers and darcy meyers   along with first time director joe charbanic   helmer of music videos for reeves  band dogstar     dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase   revealing   early on   exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop   need each other to give meaning to our lives      plus   as reeves explains     we re all stacked right on top of each other   but we don t notice each other any more      after that   it s all sound effects and tricky camera work   along with a muddled   discordant soundtrack    james spader s acting technique can be described as  wooden deadpan  while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone  dude  persona which sometimes works   sometimes doesn t    chris ellis   as spader s self important colleague   is the only cast member who manages to be convincing    on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10     the watcher   is an appallingly awful   amateurish 2   the real torture is watching it    
Neg, ahh yes    the teenage romance    an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies   and in the end   the guy always gets the girl    and with the arrival of the breakout hit `she s all that  last year   followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you  and `drive me crazy      the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity    along now comes `down to you     the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she s all that  craze with their latest project   which has the studdly freddie prinze jr   attached and all    only `down to you  doesn t have the   unlikely scenario  mentioned above    it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance   a dull   unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we re accustomed to    this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12 year old girls will find convincing    in strictly textbook fashion   college sophomore and aspiring chef al   prinze jr     meets freshman artist imogen   julia stiles      they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies    from here   it s the standard boy meets girl   boy loses girl   boy drinks entire bottle of shampoo and may or may not get girl back story    the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters   who are frequently taking part in activities that          well   only happen in the movies    fortunately   the cast of `down to you  has a certain appeal    freddie prinze jr   and julia stiles are an adorable couple   and when on screen together   they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around    zak orth   as the newly realized porn star monk   shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film s intelligent dialogue    rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy   `the faculty      selma blair   `cruel intentions    and ashton kutcher   tv s `that 70 s shows       even the fonz himself   henry winkler   the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia   has a welcome role as al s dad   the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray     maybe the concept of `down to you  looked good on paper to draw such a crowd    as a feature film   however   the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely    perhaps worst of all   `down to you  is not funny    the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired    the characters on screen   often laughing at each other s goofy/embarrassing antics   seemed far more amused than the audience    even the giggly 12 year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it s course    the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr   in a fantasy sequence called `cooks    a `cops  take off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for   needy  families   with the assistance of a fully armed swat team   of course      when this is the highlight reel   you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired    in order to make a teen comedy work   you ve got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity    `10 things i hate about you  actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards   and the result was refreshing    no such luck with `down to you     it s just a textbook romance where   despite absurd circumstances   everything is bound to work out in the end    and at the end of the whole clich   d ordeal   the nicest thing you could possibly say would be `          only in the movies     
Neg,    virus   is the type of cliched   vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it    strangely enough   on the same mid january weekend last year   another film was released like this     deep rising     about an ugly monster on a cruise liner    prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989 s   leviathan     1989 s   deep star six     and all four   alien   pictures       virus     in comparison   is a servicable thriller   well made and produced   but since it doesn t include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence   it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on    based on a series of comic books     virus   concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat   which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon    after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking     un   lucky for them   a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen    once the team reaches the russian ship   they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted    after turning the power back on   however   there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship   and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself    one survivor finally does turn up   nadia   joanna pacula     who informs the suicidal and stern captain   donald sutherland   and one of the crew   kit foster   jamie lee curtis     that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship   taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out    if   virus   sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies   you re correct    although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life   the film itself doesn t appear to have a brain in its head    the film sticks so close to the worn out conventions of the   creature   genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film    the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past   but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play    in her second return to horror in the last year   jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine   but that is about it    although 1998 s   halloween   h20   was also a disappointment   at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character   unlike here    donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films   such as 1994 s   the puppet masters     although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci fi classic   invasion of the body snatchers     where he was fabulous    the last of the three top billers is william baldwin   but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture   since he has nothing to do    basically     virus   is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one by one    it is not the worst of its type   but it is far from one of the best   and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this    as long as some of them keep making money   i suspect the answer is never    
Neg, over 40 years ago   a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira   a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind s nuclear testing    partly flight of fancy   partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry   gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo    a year later   gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things   a new name   a dubbed english track   and raymond burr    as godzilla   the film took on the rest of the world    thirty years later   toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things   yes   including raymond burr   and called it godzilla 1985    now it s 14 years after toho s remake   and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run    in emmerich s godzilla   matthew broderick plays dr   niko tatopoulos   a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms    when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river   tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states    meanwhile   tatopoulos s college girlfriend   audrey timmonds   maria pitillo     works in new york city as an assistant to a big time news reporter    she d like to be a reporter herself   and when godzilla comes ashore   she figures this is her big break    of course   with the big guy running amok in the city   niko and audrey are bound to cross paths   and are joined by victor   animal   palotti   hank azaria     audrey s trusty cameraman friend   and phillipe roche   jean reno     an operative for the french government   whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place    together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla    with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation s premiere movie production companies   one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla    he didn t    right up there with the lost world   godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history    the plot is pretty much what we expect   the big dinosaur like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city   and it s up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped   while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down    the script   however   is painfully bad    it s fraught with lines so corny   they don t even belong in b movies   and includes many character actions which make you think     you idiot     or   you stupid girl      i suppose when you ve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york   any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well    why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them   but is conveniently able to leap atop others    why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him   when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line    why do sidewinder missiles   which have small explosive warheads   blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla    why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f 18 fighter bombers   when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two    okay   maybe the last one was a bit nit picky   but hey   i was on a roll    broderick is usually a good actor   but in this film he s weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way    hank azaria does what he can   but don t expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage    like broderick s   azaria s character is quite simply lacking in color    what really annoyed me was maria pitillo   who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting    casting must have been asleep on this one    the one bright spot here is jean reno   who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic   quite unlike what we ve seem him do in the past    although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster   reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable    unfortunately   the same cannot be said of the other incongruities    the entire feel of the movie is tongue in cheek   and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it    this results in a significant amount of parody   which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster   and ends up just producing a mess    most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief   and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously    although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture   what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens    if we can t take the characters seriously   the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don t care what happens to them    godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light hearted than it should be    far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters   but here s a behemoth running through the city !  there s bound to be a lot of casualties   but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after school g   i    joe cartoon syndrome   where almost everyone seems to get out of harm s way just in time    in a couple of scenes   godzilla briefly breathes fire    none of the characters even remark upon this ability   nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers    it s as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes   godzilla can do this   just like in the old movie    consider another punch pulled    through creative script writing   you can make a sequel out of just about any movie   but the final scene in this one doesn t just leave the door open   it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently    it made me want to gag    emmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in jokes and played this one as a straight action film    with an intelligently written screenplay   godzilla could have been so much more    however   by confusing the viewer with a ton of add ins and parodies   the movie ends up being something that just doesn t work    now if they only had raymond burr          
Neg, before the remake of psycho appears   we ve got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film   dial m for murder    as usual   hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars   and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing    the film opens with emily   paltrow   and david   viggo mortensen    having fun  in an loft apartment    the problem is   paltrow is married to stephen   douglas     who is not too happy when he discovers this affair    if i was paltrow   though   i d definitely go with mortensen    less wrinkles    anyhow   stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition   he ll pay him to kill his lovely wife    mortensen agrees   but the murder goes awry   and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses    unfortunately   the film dosen t progress very fast    in fact   it moves like a tortoise with arthritis   read   very   very s l o w      the plot moves nowhere fast   and only becomes exciting in very short bursts    not too good for a  thriller      also   the performances   apart from douglas   are below par    paltrow   showing immense talent in se7en   1995   and sliding doors   1997   is strangely stilted   even unconvincing   in this movie    mortensen is a little bit better   coming across as a younger douglas   but his role isn t meaty enough to show all his talent    which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film   which is does    however   i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking   drinking womanizer with a creepy underside    also popping up in the film is david suchet   playing a shifty looking detective    again   it s not a character we re seeing on the screen   it s david suchet    the director   who bought us the fugitive   piles on all the flash techniques   such as zoom in s   quick cuts   etc   the lighting is also interesting    however   looks can t save this film from the depths of mediocre   and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway    the screenplay is o   k   but there s some hackneyed sub plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street   again   and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched    the characters also make incredibly dumb moves   especially paltrow   and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel    with a combination of no tension   drama   or decent characters   a perfect murder is a failure all round   and an incredible disappointment    there are a few bright moments   but they are far and few between    the last thing a thriller should be is boring   and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas   you wouldn t be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder    overall rating=  review by david wilcock   1998     you know   for kids     norville barnes  
Neg, coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers   relentless   1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz   played by character actor leo rossi   spawned three more sequels    relentless 3   third in the row   features sam dietz again   but this time detective   who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case   doesn t want to deal with similar line of work    divorced   demoralised and transferred   he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer   and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz s old cases    to make things even more interesting   it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation    fans of the british tv films and mini series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies    they both feature vicious psychopathic killers   yet also give a lot of   usually depressive   details about chief investigator s private lives    this one isn t an exception   but similarities with british television are only in content    the execution and style is different   which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best    useless   gratuitous erotica also doesn t help either   obviously making this film longer than it should be    the actors are good   though   leo rossi is fine as usual   and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career    signy coleman as dietz s love interest   is   on the other hand   quite miscast    but she won t have to worry about it in the future career   since relentless 3 wasn t supposed to be anybody s finest moment anyway    
Neg, edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back   and like his previous two   it is a working class relationship picture    however   unlike his previous work   the film dwells on a more personal story   and with a female protagonist    and in no looking back   he stumbles   making a slow   boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work    claudia   lauren holly   is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life    she s at a turning point in her life   and feels as if she s going nowhere    her boyfriend   michael   jon bon jovi     is broke and in a dead end job    if she were to marry him   she d never get a chance to escape this town    enter charlie   edward burns     claudia s old flame    he skipped town several years before   without any explanations       even  for claudia    he has come back to town to see her   and suddenly she is torn    should she stay with stable michael   and never escape her hometown       or  should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again    part of the answer lies in the character of her mother   blythe danner     who fell for the wrong man       and has spent her life pining for claudia s father to return    now it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes    at only a little past ninety minutes   no looking back is rather short for its genre    unfortunately   it seems much much longer    the storyline is simple and uninspired   and there s a lack of energy to the whole proceedings   which makes the entire drama rather tedious    edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame    there s no one to restrain his ego   which reigns unchecked    he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons       yeah    right    lauren holly does what she can with her central character    but we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions       and  we never really care    bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie    his acting talents are much greater than they might seem   but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with    there s not much to recommend in no looking back    it s not that the film is bad       it s  simply boring    there s no zest in any aspect of the film   and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it    
Neg, i don t expect much from eddie murphy these days    for the past four years   the gods of cinema  or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates  have allowed him to make one bad movie after another    such films as metro   doctor dolittle   holy man   life   and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures    the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film   nutty professor ii   the klumps    the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump   an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places    sherman has just invented a new   youth drink   that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time    janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor   and for the most ridiculous reasons      with love on his mind   sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego   buddy love from the first professor   who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers    with some convoluted mumbo jumbo about dna extraction   sherman extracts the   buddy love   link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy dandy lab beaker    but one night   the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated        because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy    then the klump family   all played by eddie murphy   step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex   flabby breasts   a slew of fart and dick jokes   and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes    and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster    the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world    with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene    pure and simple   the klumps is a failure    its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters   and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes    any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process    it s more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz   the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade   american pie   have their names stamped to this trash    hey guys   quick note   keep this movie off of your resumes    the characterization of sherman s family   the klumps   is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema    everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough    the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts    the father is gruff   is fired from a blue collar job   is sexually inadequate   and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings    the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone    the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood    sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to    but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy    the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct    and you got the feeling that these crass people couldn t act like this all the time    the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt   making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic    after a while   their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story    its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker    who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london    and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line    even the best effects can t seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days    now that i think about it   the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make    people will be lined up around the block for it    the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002    eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles   but he ll play every character in the movie    i just can t wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself    
Neg, brian de palma   the director who bought us carrie   dressed to kill and mission   impossible is back   and has bought all his technical expertise with him    sadly   he forget to bring a good story and believable characters    nic cage plays rick santaro   a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne   sinise      an assassination takes place   and santaro tries to peace together how it took place   trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy    the film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together    however   the film doesn t keep the mystery for long   and once the big  secret  is out concerning kevin dunne   the film is at a dead end    although there are some fantastic shots by de palma   including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film   halfway through the film drops dead    the problem is that de palma doesn t have a strong story or characters to work with    he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques   but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience   and i quickly got bored    nic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters   but it s no use    they are boring   faceless   and completely unlikeable    yes   another problem with the film is that there s no one to root for    we re supposed to be on cage s side   because his character becomes nicer throughout the film    however   his change is sadly unbelievable    poor gary sinise s character is terrible   who completely changes throughout the start   the middle and the end   in an appalling way    the film s use of flashback quickly gets boring    while clever and interesting the first few times   it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go    they certainly don t increase the tension or suspense of the movie    there is small thread of suspense running through the film   but it certainly doesn t make this film a powerhouse thriller   rather just a slightly below average one    the script is lousy and contrived   the characters flat and two dimensional    certainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller    the most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential    there s a good story buried in snake eyes   it s just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks    it also gives itself away far too quickly   rather than leaving the big twist for the end    while the performances are intriguing   especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy  number cruncher  wrapped up in the case   there s no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance   and unless you re a big fan of either cage or flash directing   should be avoided    a david wilcock review   1998     you know   for kids     norville barnes

Neg, lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4   episode 1 is a boring   empty spectacle that features some nice special effects    after the familiar  a long time ago            opening   the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game    the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo   ruled by queen amidala   portman   jedi knights qui gon   neeson   and obi wan   mcgregor   are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade    however   this simple blockade is not all it seems   and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers   including facing the evil darth maul   ray park      they also meet the future darth vadar   anakin skywalker   jake lloyd    star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking   script   direction and characters    the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic    the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star   and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non existent    there s no underlying tension   and no urgent need to see what the outcome is    the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story   which doesn t help    there s no snap to make the film work   it moves at a plod    the script is boring   all the characters speak in morals   especially anakins mother    there s no group spirit evident here   and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders   it s evident that not much is going to happen    the two leads are hideously boring   static characters given little to do and too much time to do it    qui gon and obi wan hold no presence on film   and give little for the audience to root for    the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul   if he had been given more screen time    maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history   even if he does provide the only  straight  plot line in the film   all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy      anakin is annoying and unlikeable      instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended    it s probably not surprising that his hateful little boy   unfortunately blessed  ani  by everyone he knows   joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible    the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks   although in the end none is provided in the film by him    although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys   the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny    the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a  pod  racer   because i knew he wouldn t be able to talk for a while    queen amidala is a nothing in the film   she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must  serve her people     and go goo goo over anakin    again   her role will become more important in the later episodes   and is given little to do here    the actors don t help the movie much either    liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed   and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible    mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy   with little charm    the casting director must have chose him because he s scottish like alec guinness   there s little other explanation for it    natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script   but she delivers a spunky performance    and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice    there s very little talent evident with him   it s hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there    he s not even very  cute      the main claim of the film   the special effects   are okay    there s nothing impressive about them   yet they complement the story well    the cgi takes away much of the human element   however    the battle droids for example   the replacement for the stormtroopers   are characterless little computer graphics   lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers    episode 1 is just disappointing    it s got high production values   but little else    the music is meandering   except near the end    the plot gives us no one to root for   or even care for    the effects are nice   but dull    the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should    there s an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair   and many clich   s are catered for throughout the film    apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence   episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose   except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film    disappointing is barely the word    rating=  
Neg, five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there   is this starting to sound familiar     by mistake    the girls accidentlly open the box   big surprise   huh !   and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one   betcha didn t see that one coming !      hard to die   i found out while watching the film   is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2   nightie nightmare   r   a   m   r   #  1521      two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film   robyn harris and melissa moore   but they play different characters here    orville ketchum is also back as   get ready for this   orville ketchum   yes   the same character from number two      yes   he is also built like a tank in this film too    i m telling you   a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn t harm him at all !  the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act   well they seemed to have lost that ability    thankfully   for my sanity   i also saw the film warlock   which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film    the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks    any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line    the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out   analyzed   and discarded before it happens    there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot    while we are on the subject of the story   the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress    the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager s office    i m sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary   ridiculous   and hurts the story more   if that is still possible      the script for this film is completely pathetic    the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible    the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along    here is an example of the wonderful dialog    the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun    the line is   my dad used to be a marine   i bet i can work it      this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy    now   we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan     ! !     has been presented    one comment from an actress is   not a lot of strategy involved   but i like it      i m afraid folks that this is about as good as they get    now lets talk about the great special effects for this film    this obviously wasn t a big concern of the film makers    the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer s intelligence    a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie    are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get    the continuity department was obviously asleep   along with the viewers   when watching this film    in one shot   actress has cloths on   camera angle changes   actress seems to have lost clothing    very impressive trick !  the one   half      plus that this film has going for it   is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious    the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny   and so the viewer can get some enjoyment     ! !     from the film    however   this doesn t make it worth the rental fee of over a penny    in the acting department   the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down    i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic   but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least    oh well   win some   lose some    
Neg, the first film produced by adam sandler s happy madison production company   clever title eh     is essentially a one joke movie   much like the movies sandler stars in himself    however the difference here is that this one joke just isn t very funny    rob schneider stars as the title character   a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a   man whore   to raise enough money to replace a wealthy client s custom made fish tank   which deuce destroyed while staying in his home    deuce goes on numerous   dates     and each woman he goes out with has a   humorous   quirk about herself    one has narcolepsy   one has tourette s syndrome   one is a man        etc   etc    my problem is that we see all of these women in the film s trailer   so why do i need to watch the movie    seen the trailer        seen the film    only a quick cameo from norm macdonald   and a follow up joke during the closing credits   generates any chuckles    deuce bigalow   male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video   a division of di$ney      the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1   85   1   and features the original theatrical trailer   as well as trailers for mystery alaska   happy texas   and outside providence     an extremely brief production featurette   which contains footage not used in the film     and storyboard to scene comparisons    yep   you read that right        there are storyboard comparisons on this dvd    two scenes are storyboarded        neither of which are particularly exciting    there are fight scenes in this movie   so why aren t we seeing storyboards of those segments   especially the parody moments from the matrix      i wonder what s funnier   the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that di$ney thought fans of this film would want to see them    deleted scenes    sure    audio commentary    you betcha    but storyboards    come on    [r]  
Neg, tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie    the film   which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states   is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage   and   while it s evident that this could be a fascinating live production   the translation to the screen is a creative disaster    enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art    lifeless and tedious    the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium    tectonic plates has a storyline   although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non traditional fashion   with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences    it s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie   despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious   all but screaming     look !  art !        although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters    because we re constantly made aware that we re watching a play or a movie   it s impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer s ideas    they re not real   sympathetic   or believable    i m willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different   but this particular experiment is not a success    tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine   marie gignac     an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor   jacques   lapage      one day   he disappears   and   fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love   madeleine travels to venice to kill herself    while preparing to commit suicide   she encounters drug addict constance   celine bonnier     who causes madeleine to re think her decision    meanwhile   jacques has moved to new york city   where he starts cross dressing   calls himself jennifer   and becomes a successful counter culture talkshow host    with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland   supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute   and cultural references that point to chopin   george sand   and jim morrison   tectonic plates is unique   if nothing else    however   as interesting as the film sounds   and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising     it never really delivers    the tone is soporific   the supposedly intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting   the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner   although it doesn t take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant     and the symbolism is obvious    tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth   but it takes one hundred minutes to get across this transparent point    there are some worthwhile moments   such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages   although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren t bilingual      the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because   a   it s different     b   it s not like anything they ve seen before   and   c   it s pretentious    for everyone else   it s not only a waste of time   but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage

staggering workload   and extremely ill fortune on the set    impressive photography   but really only interesting to film historians    sadie thompson   u   s   a     1928   director   raoul walsh screenwriter   raoul walsh   from the john colton play   rain     based on w   somerset maugham s story   miss thompson   cast   gloria swanson   raoul walsh   lionel barrymore silent  after the discussion of the newly restored version of frank capra s lost horizon   where several scenes had been restored using stills   i was interested to see sadie thompson   where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago    this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story   miss thompson      this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen  little awkwardness   and a very clever script    the actors   gloria swanson   raoul walsh   who also directed and wrote the screenplay   and especially lionel barrymore   as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie s soul   but really wants to get her between the sheets   is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel    swanson adds real life to the character   adding an worldly   affectionate air to the bawdy sadie    unfortunately   the ending is rather poorly tied up   it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live action film   or the original script    the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on   i cannot believe maugham s short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia     the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we ve been waiting an hour and a half for    still   it s entertaining right up to the end   certainly barrymore s incredibly hammy performance   which   nonetheless   works   perhaps due to the silent screen   is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells   bakkers   and robertses of the religious worlds    a c movie   worth 2   50 if you can find it    the pied piper   czechoslovakia   1986   director   jim barta screenwriter   kamil piza  this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids    it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate   and with a lot of political comment along with it    perhaps economic content is a better word  it certainly doesn t show capitalism in a good light    nor human nature   nor anything else   for that matter    as you may have guessed   this is not a tgif film   this is the kind of film you are glad is over    not that it wasn t interesting for technical reasons   this is stop animation that is very well done    all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts  except for the animated stuffed rats    boy   sounds like a real comedy vehicle   doesn t it    add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison   and you have something to give the wee ones   and some of the mentally unstable larger folk   to keep them up at night    some gore    don t bring children to this one    don t bring adults to this one   unless they re fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped    blech       no fun whatsoever    meier   west germany   1986   director/screenwriter   peter timm cast   rainier grenkowitz   nadja engelbrecht   alexander hauff   thomas besvater sub titled  this film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier   an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money    his uncle   also in the west   sneaks meier out of the country   unknown to the east germans    meier   however   is less than thrilled   his girlfriend   his friends and his job   which he likes   all exist in east germany    after a round the world trip   his boss think s he s on leave in bulgaria     meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id   and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew s work  while everyone think s he s still living in east germany    of course   something goes wrong  and the ending is very funny   but it takes the film too long to get there    the humor is spread too thin   and much of the plot is too obvious   as is the acting      still   a good concept for the comedy   and the last five minutes are pretty funny    c    $2   50    the right hand man   australia   1986   director   di drew screenplay   helen hodgman cast   rupert everett   hugo weaving   arthur dignam   jennifer claire   catherine mcclements  after a lifetime of movie going   and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival   i ve learned several rules which   while not absolute   should certainly be given deference to    1   be wary of french comedies    these people like jerry lewis    2   ken russell is never going to grow up   no matter how long you wait    3   any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as   old pouty lips   is probably not worth watching    4   when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography   watch out !  australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo   but since weir and miller left for foreign shores   finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult   not impossible  witness malcolm last year   task    well   i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night   and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards    it s as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30 s about tragedy among the gentry   and falling in love with people below your station   and horses    lots and lots of horses    the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship   which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing   because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir    unfortunately   said son   a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times   kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident    highlights include the amputation sequence   the doctor s daughter   who has the hots for the son   tasting his urine for a diagnosis   their tender kissing with a window between them   while it s raining  you d think a woman studying medicine would know better      the photography is good   but i kept wishing for b&w  everything seems sepia colored anyway    actually   i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead   but that s life    grade   z   avoid like the plague   unless you re looking for inadvertent yuks    
Neg, capsule   the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies   dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension    alien 3   the   3   should be in superscript   is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen    it continues the story of ripley   the space trucker turned impromptu survivalist   but seems remarkably uninterested in her    in fact   the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all   it s so elegaic and limp    a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere   but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning    at the end of the last film   aliens     ripley and two survivors were on their way home    unfortunately   an alien pod had been deposited in their ship   and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod    the pod crashes on firorina 161   a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent    ripley lives through the crash   the others do not    the prison is a grim place   even as prisons go    it s been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks   which provides no end of techno gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against    lice are endemic   and so ripley s head is shaved   another surreal touch      at first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive   but it doesn t stay that way    one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches   and soon a newly gestated alien is running amuck    worse   it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated    what s weird is how little tension this generates   except near the end   when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable   loud music   shaky camerawork   etc   sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role   and she does well with it   but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack    the supporting actors are also not given a lot to do   the doctor   charles dance   and another   rather religious inmate   charles s   dutton   very good     hiave presence   but they re not asked to do anything with it    in light of the impending sequel   which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie   i will not talk about the ending    except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie    it s strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn t have driven the rest of it    
Neg,    from the director of   the nightmare before christmas   it said in the previews   which i m guessing was said to get people to go see the movie   obviously it hasn t worked since the $75 million dollar movie has yet to break $5 million    to each it s own however   since   monkey bone   is not only a bad movie all together   but technically well made    a tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects    stu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena   monkey bone   a crude comic strip   that everyone wants to merchandise   they go to great links to get it as well   including dollars that let out fart powder    when stu and his girlfriend   julie   bridget fonda   are in a freak car accident   you ll see   stu goes into a coma   and while in his coma stu travels to i m guessing dark town   where all the characters in dreams come to life    people are stuck in this town   with their nightmares roaming around them    when stu spots monkey bone   whom he really can t stand   he tries to keep him under control    making a new friend kitty   rose mcgowan   he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death   he can go back up and live his life    when monkey bone and stu steal a pass   monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stu s body    now monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder   so everyone has nightmares       or  something like that    rather complex   in fact more than it needs to be     monkey bone   had potential in the script and even the story    what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes   and lack of character development    for instance we really don t get to know who stu or julie are   so why should we even care    kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her   but we are not given a chance to know her    the cast is decent however   brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley   but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body    bridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt   her performance is bad and she seems miscast    dave foley isn t given enough to do   as well as   will & grace s   megan mullally who can be funny    the standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself   he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust    the special effects of   monkey bone   is what might really bring in some curious viewers   these special effects are highly effective   and nice to look at with the eyes    some of them are believable and some unbelievable       for  monkey bone he seems to be like stuart little   you really don t realize that he is animated       but  on occasion it sneaks up on you    the direction by henry selick is good   but at times he doesn t know what kind of film he wants to make   and the ending climax falls off the cliff    it s too bad really     monkey bone   could have been a real good movie   but with it s heavily done hack job   and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role    for those curious however   it might be worth the rental   but other than that avoid this one    
Neg, numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci fi   suspense thrillers    soldier is a multi   crossbreed between the likes of terminator   aliens and offspring    the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel   not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground    besides this   the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age    the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured   slow and sluggish   and could have done with better choreography    russell who is usually a good actor in b grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character   sergeant todd   who seems more like a sergeant toad    besides having almost no dialogue   his character appears stunted   zombie like which is in line with his screen persona   but scores little points of empathy with the audience    this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson   whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth    although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former   it is still a long way from anything considered desirable    
Neg, a documentary from the twin hughes brothers   allen and albert   dead presidents   menace ii society     about street pimps   all of whom are african american    an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession    it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho s   and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be   is what you get    i learned that the word   bitch   is their favorite word   as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used    it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say   but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about   then some of what they rap about might seem amusing    they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen   in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money    it s also a power trip   accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them   mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place    this sleazy pic   soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears    these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face    the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models   the feather hatted   fur coated   diamond ring wearing   gold chain wearing   flashy cadillac cruising pimp of the late  70s blaxploitation movies  like the mack and willie dynamite    also used as reference   was iceberg slim s best seller pimp   the story of my life    we meet pimps such as   fillmore slim   c note   charm   k red   gorgeous dre   bishop don magic juan   and rosebudd    they readily discuss their business arrangements   including percentages   lifestyles   knockin   stealing another pimp s ho     and the thrill they get from women giving them money    these dudes needed no prompting to talk   as they just love to brag about about themselves       priests need nuns      yaps c note   a san francisco pimp       doctors need nurses    so ho s need pimps       as he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make   that the girls need them to show them the ropes   how to make money   to be their security blankets   protectors   and counselors    the race issue was brought up right from the film s onset   as a number of white interviewees   regular citizens   note that their impression of a pimp   is that he s the lowest form of human    while   we are told   in the black community   the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur   riding around in fancy cars   flashing wads of money   dressed in a flamboyant style   where his snake gaiter shoes might cost him a grand   and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community    we also see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt   as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery   of master and slave relations    the film was all about pimp style and their projected image   as they run a hard sell riff about the virtues of their work    there are different styles of pimping   but the film mentions them only as being   macks   and   players   or   real pimps   and   perpetrator pimps     but no further clarity is attempted    it is also failed to get the women s side to this story of abuse   primarily taking the pimp at his word    the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does   as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps   who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing   hungry for their 15 minutes of fame    the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture   was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to    danny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimp s wardrobe    while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd   married his ho and turned square   working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer    
Neg, gord brody   tom green   is an aspiring animator approaching thirty who still lives in parents jim   rip torn   and julie s   julie hagerty     airplane     basement    as dad declares all out war   gord secures a job in a cheese sandwich factory in far off la and sets off to make his dreams come true    gord doesn t make much of a go on his first attempt and lands back home with fawning mom and outraged dad in   freddy got fingered      tom green cowrites   with   tom green show   scribe derek harvie     directs and stars in what is essentially tom green s primal scream    so   if tom green screams in an empty theater   does he make a sound    it s clear that   freddy got fingered   is at least partially autobiographical and green sure has one hell of a complex about his dad   mom gets off easier when sonny boy advises her to go out and have sex with basketball players and greeks      while this may be of interest to his hard core fans   there s little about green s mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else    the film starts promisingly enough   with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set to the sex pistols   problem    green s put together a first rate soundtrack   and yes   i laughed a few times    green s flummoxing of a security guard with psychotic ramblings and his attempt to draw   make music and eat at the same time   the  daddy would you like some sausages  scene repeatedly shown in the film s trailer   are inspired comedy    but what s funny about a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by having her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap    a baby delivery bit shows some groan inducing promise until enough blood is splattered to coagulate the laughs    younger   by three years   brother freddy s internment at the institute for sexually abused children does nothing but confirm one s worst fears regarding the film s title and green s infamous  handling  of a real horse   while not nearly as shocking as it would seem   doesn t make sense    by the time he repeats the gag with an elephant at film s end   the overall effect is numbness    while   freddy got fingered   has the admirable end result of depicting the harm in demeaning a child s self esteem   it s essentially a whole lot of tom green running around being noisy    rip torn   what were you thinking    
Neg, much ado about nothing    ah   how sweet the irony !  it s accepted wisdom in some circles   among english literature nuts   mainly   that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance    he just doesn t   understand   shakespeare   you will hear them say    the bard s work is apparently beyond criticism    what a load of old cobblers    if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh s film of shakespeare s   comedy   much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word   it s time to get a life    get monty python    get woody allen    get john waters    whatever    just get a real taste of some clever   witty   risky comedy    and banish this nonsense to where it belongs    drama and tragedy was shakespeare s strength    to my sensibilities   and i m no stick in the mud   much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever    no kidding   this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going    the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend   as this was our day out and i hadn t seen her in ages    but boy   does she owe me one !  i won t spend too much time on the plot    basically   we follow the trials and tribulations of two would be couples   one young   the other older    there s some dark treachery amongst all this   but everyone is so awfully jolly that you d hardly know it    mind you   there s nothing wrong with the basic story    good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound    nothing wrong with most of the cast   either    branaugh   emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers    the problem is the script   or more accurately   shakespeare s original text    light comedy shouldn t be complex    yet wrapped in elizabethan english   the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend    for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good   undemanding laugh    the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves   the actor once again miscast as a jealous half brother or something    but when dissected and understood   what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame    this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold    ho   ho   ho   boy likes girl !  ho   ho   ho   men are such klutzes !  ho   ho   ho   she s so awfully clumsy !  oh please !  there s wit in here somewhere   i m told    i call it pretentious    something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay    in the end   it s cringeworthy    watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience    comedy    bah   humbug !  
Neg, another formula  feel good  quirky comedy from the british isles   much like   waking ned devine     and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line    it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town   such as tolerant vicars and policemen   plenty of eccentrics   and of locals who stick together through thick and thin    the strength of this film lies in its rational theme   that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol    the film is tolerable until after its first hour   it then falls completely apart   becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas    but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to   at least   be viewed as containing a pertinent message    its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the  war on drugs  is about to be escalated into colombia    the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future   it has so far just ended up causing america s jails to be overcrowded with non violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america s drug usage and drug supply    billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war   by backing a corrupt government   remember vietnam !   with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country    everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam   with this scenario closer to home   so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war    the film s mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public   something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago   is a theme long overdue for public acceptance   but one that is better received late than never    there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this   rather than making it a police matter altogether    the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle aged woman   grace   brenda blethyn     who fell out of an airplane   evidently committing suicide    the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined    he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up   without her knowledge   their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage    the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband s enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless    she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london   honey   quick      what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying   is that when conferring with honey   she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her    even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can   the creditors swoop down on her like vultures    her gardener and handyman   matthew   ferguson     decides to stay on with her   despite his last check bouncing    since she is an expert amateur horticulturist   he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants   which he grows for private use    the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity   as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high quality stuff    for grace   this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt   for the scotsman   matthew   it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky   valerie      the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed   the police sergeant   campbell   pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace s greenhouse is for   the friendly vicar   phillips   counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can t control   and the doctor   clunes   enjoys smoking the weed for recreation    the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big time drug dealer instead of having matthew go   because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn t want matthew to end up in jail    it is interesting to note   that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you   only that one can go to jail    the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london   trying to find a drug dealer   while dressed out of place   in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal   was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole   whereby it never recovered its dignity    the film moves into the formula mode   whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive   as she meets an international drug dealer   a frenchman   tcheky karyo     who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences   thereby becoming a celebrity    things work out in a ridiculous way   where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace   where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood    there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale   as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone   until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded    this  unhip  film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly   but should be tolerated as something naughty middle aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute    ummm !

Neg,    love to kill   starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes    at the outset   the movie appears to be about tony danza   who s an illegal distributor of guns   trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman    danza sets up a double date with her   her sister   and a collegue of his    everything seems to be going well   until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs    much confusion and mahem ensues   as the death is covered up and other associates of danza s begin to emerge   all after one thing or another    sound confusing    it is    i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity    in some respects   it works    but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess    characters keep popping up with no explanation   demanding money for deals that occur off screen    the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman s sister    but so little time is devoted to this part of the story   we never really become too familiar with these characters   and because of this   we don t really care what happens to them    well   i didn t   at least    one thing i will give the movie is that it s a complete departure for tony danza    here s a guy   because of his many sitcom roles   who s ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing    here   he plays a man who s just looking out for himself   and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin   so be it    i was very impressed by his performance   and within minutes of the start of the film   i had forgotten all about his good guy persona    michael madsen is also good as an associate of danza s who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him    like i said   it s not exactly a linear storyline       love to kill   should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre   but it s just too bad that the story doesn t really add up to much    the stars deserved better   and so did the audience    
Neg, whether you like the beatles or not   nobody wants to see the bee gee s take on some of the fab four s best known songs    well   maybe that s not true            maybe you re curious   the way you have to look in your hanky after you blow your nose    you just have to know how bad bad can be    if that s the case   rejoice   because it was twenty years ago today   or so   that sgt    pepper s lonely hearts club band was released   unleashed     to the world   and thanks to our modern technological advances   you can find this retched piece of filmmaking on vhs    derived from the lyrics of various beatles  songs   sgt    pepper s tells the story of the fictitious band made popular from the song   and album   of the same name   released in 1967    of course   the movie was made eleven years later   the gibbs three have become the lonely hearts   peter frampton is the one and only billy shears   and aside from being about a rock band   the story doesn t correlate to the song at all    and oh   what joy   we re the lovely audience they d like to take home with them    i don t think so    but at least these characters are actually * people * in a beatles  song   whereas other characters such as strawberry fields   sandy farina   gets her name from a song about a * place * called strawberry fields    the debate over this is really quite futile when it comes down to it   because all the film really has to offer is a feast of horrid cover tunes   embarrassing cameo appearances   george burns   !  steve martin   !    alice cooper   !   !     and uuuuuuggggggglllllllyyyyy 70 s fashion and faces    check please !  the plot is a bit unclear    people with bad 70 s hair run around in leisure suits engaging in music video sequences that look like a sick and twisted world of make believe from an overly demented mr   rogers    mean mr   mustard   frankie howerd   somehow gets hold of all billy & co    s instruments   calling dr   maxwell edison   steve martin with a silver hammer and an out of key singing voice     the sun king   marvin sunk   alice cooper !     and a couple of creepy robots to his aid    supposedly this is a horrible thing    i guess in heartland   the talent is pretty non existent    meanwhile   the lonely hearts are off doing the classic   sex   drugs   and rock n  roll   thing   leaving poor strawberry fields without her true love   billy    she sets out to find him   leaving her poor dad and mom   mrs    fields !  hey   wanna cookie      all alone to sing a horrible rendition of   she s leaving home     accompanied by those same creepy robots    but is billy getting it on with lucy   dianne steinberg      ya know   the diamond possessing girl who hangs out in the sky    well   there s some crazy chick singing soprano on the roof of a building next to a bus stop   and i assume that s who it was    it s movies like this that make ya sit back and ask the unanswerable question     what the hell were they thinking          nobody will ever know   but as a novelty   sgt    pepper s is one to examine    carol channing   robert palmer   keith carradine   they re all here    but why          who knows    it s irrelevant    there s as much meaning to be found here as there is to be found in your belly button lint   although the latter may be more interesting    with the recent onslaught of 70 s nostalgia in the movie world   the ice storm   boogie nights   reissues of the star wars trilogy   etc       let s pray this doesn t get a special 20th anniversary   second chance in theaters    in the words of paul mccartney   live and let die    in fact   bury this one while you still can    
Neg, warning   spoilers are included in this review        but it doesn t really make much of a difference    deep impact begins the official summer movie season   and it also brings back memories of 1997    remember when dante s peak came out in february    a few months later   volcano was released    the first film was smart   exhilirating   and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen    the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent    well   it s deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition    this time   unfortunately   the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon   the upcoming comet disaster to be released the beginning of july    of course   the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine   and so i am in the minority   as i was when i stood on the side of dante s peak    but while watching deep impact   i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film    apparently many did   and it utterly baffles me    to be completely honest   i haven t had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life    volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo   but it was still rather fun to watch    deep impact doesn t just have implausibilities   it also contains cheap human drama   incredibly horrible special effects   and a poorly constructed plot    the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters    deep impact begins in an unnamed year   the year varies   advanced technology sets it in the future   but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater   pushing it back to 1993      a line of students is outside at night   peering through telescopes at the dark sky above    among these are leo biederman   elijah wood   and sarah hotchner   leelee sobieski      leo unknowingly discovers a comet   and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer   who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds    he races off to mail the information   but is killed in a reckless car accident    a year passes   and nothing is heard about it again    we are then introduced to jenny lerner   t   a leoni     a reporter for msnbc    she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse   james cromwell      she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie    after talking with rittenhouse   and unsatisfied with the information she gets   she decides to use the internet for help    luckily   she knows exactly how to spell the certain   ellie   that she is looking for   they spell it ele in the film        that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled      before she can use the information   the government decides to push her car off the road    they take her in to meet the president of the united states   president beck   morgan freeman      beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference    naturally   she wants to be compensated   and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question    and so   yada yada yada   they reveal the comet to the public and their plans   send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive    they announce a plan called   ark     which is their only hope for survival    a computer will select 800   000 people at random    these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won t kill off the entire human race    after two years   the dust will settle   actually   it would take much   much longer  approximately ninety years   from what i understand   and the humans could come back to the surface and start over    the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures   but there is one subplot worth mentioning    jenny and her father   jason   maximilian schell     have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom    the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional    it s a shame that nothing else is heartfelt    now   of course   we all know that the comet does impact the surface    the title alone suggests it   and the previews actually show it !  by doing this   absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won t work    director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show   er      her major film debut was the peacemaker   a pathetic and heartless action film    well   this time leder outdid herself   creating a film worse than that one    suggestion to ms   leder   please   stay away from the big screen   or at least the action genre    much of the blame can be placed on leder directly   because the pace is disastrously off    throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed   it goes from months to weeks to hours      it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real time  it s that boring    of course   leder isn t all to blame for it    screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time    what starts out promising soon turns deadly   for the audience anyway      chock full of cheesy one liners     you know   you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school !      and stupid characters   you might think we were back in the 70s again    only one of the subplots is remotely interesting   while the rest are forgettable and boring    and the main plot is so outrageous that you can t figure out if this film is supposed to be an action   drama   or sci fi    to put it simply   the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation    that s right   80% miss   and 20% hit    scenes above the earth are well done   and the orbiting ship is majestic    but the comet is a huge mistake   making it more laughable than frightening    the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough   but that s forgiveable    what isn t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface    give me a break   will ya    and of course   the much hyped collision of comet and earth    well   it is far from spectacular   and it makes independence day look brilliant    the water rushing towards the land is effective   but once it hits the continent   the effects turn ridiculous    cgi water is used   and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks    in fact   i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days    just when we think visual effects can t be improved   along comes a film to show that they really can and should be    one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder s direction   which also influences the actors    leder loves to show the actors  faces before and during moments of terror    this reminded me of another action director   renny harlin   die hard 2   cliffhanger      but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations    leder likes to flaunt people s fears via their faces   but instead of coming off as sympathetic   leder seems more of a sadist    one moment has an astronaut flying off into space    this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience   but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person s face while drifting into space    this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience   and i   for one   am not going to be fooled    on another note   leder s film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts    the pace does pick up   and some very emotional moments are shown    then again   when you watch people cry for their loved ones   it s obvious it will be emotional    it s mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into   feeling   for the characters   but it didn t work for me    but anyway   the actors do as much as they can with what they are given    t   a leoni   bad boys   tv s   the naked truth     is the best of the film   and she is given the meatiest role    her character is made stronger by leoni s presence   and we grow to care for her    robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch   but his character is turned into shreds by the plot    elijah wood also comes off rather successfully   but he still hasn t had many good roles   wood   stick to drama !  you are too talented for this stuff      vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable   and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen    maximilian schell is distracting   but he does provide some nice humor    morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this   and gives one of his most shallow performances to date   which is quite remarkable for him      leelee sobieski could have been better   but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character    a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby    eldard is good in his role   but is limited by the plot    crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv s   star trek   the next generation      seeing her was one of the highlights of the film    overall   a very talented cast virtually wasted    deep impact is rated pg 13 for disaster related elements and brief language    this is one of the worst films of the year   and if it is any omen of things to come   this summer could be one of the worst ever    luckily   the x files movie is coming up   and hopefully armageddon will be more successful    it s a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn t worth much    costing nearly $75 million   with special effects done by the illustrious ilm   which is a huge shocker     and with a score composed by oscar winner james horner   titanic     one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience    well   it s not    when the comet does hit the earth   you almost wish it could just take this film along with it    
Neg, my first press screening of 1998 and already i ve gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list    what an auspicious beginning !  welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l   a   and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere    firestorm   the directorial debut of dances with wolves s academy award winning cinematographer dean semler   is the first of the new year s crop of movies    as our story opens   the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are   smokejumpers      we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl   where one of the gung ho guys is taking a romance quiz from   cosmopolitan      having the time of their lives   they then jump into the middle of a burning forest    when   even in the beginning   the director can t get the small parts right   you can sense the movie is in trouble    with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline filled cars   smokejumper monica   christianne hirt   tells them to get away from their soon to explode vehicles    not bothering to shout nor even get close to them   she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people    miraculously   they manage to hear her and move away    in a movie that specializes in cheap shots   the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building    as it does throughout   overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f   windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl s face    our show s two heroes   the crew s chief   wynt perkins   played laconically by scott glenn   and his second in command   jesse graves   played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal   enter the burning house looking for the little girl    in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames    the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse    this mawkish show cuts back to monica   who has a life or death decision to make    the chopper with the fire retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group    will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica s two firefighting buddies    she has only seconds to decide who will be saved    yes   she goes for the majority   but   miracle of miracles   the other three come out alive anyway    not content with a traditional firefighting story   chris soth s screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape         hoods in the woods     is what the   ground pounders   yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire      along the way   shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis   who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father   who was a marine drill instructor    most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing    he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck    arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside    using a ramp   he shoots straight out of the top of the building s attic   and when he hits the ground   he just rides off in a cloud of dust    when the film isn t using some stock footage of actual forest fires   the simulated ones look hokey    editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions    the ending   with its sick twists   manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie    perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby     it s not as bad as some of the television sitcoms      firestorm runs mercifully just 1   29    it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers    
Neg, ever since wargames   the first real computer hacking movie   hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking    these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous    if it s not this   the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect    hackers is guilty of all of these crimes    to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet   most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can t take it anymore    those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web   the internet movie database   are probably aware of the section for movies entitled   goofs      this is the section for mistakes in the movies    well   imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed     generally ill informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology      and truthfully   this is one hundred percent correct    the plot   obviously   centers around computer hacking    more specifically   it follows the exploits of dade murphy   a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller    miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting   because if it were not for that   who knows where his career would be now after hackers    the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems    he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old    the film then picks up at that point   an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer    dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn   angelina jolie     cereal killer   matthew lillard     lord nikon   laurence mason     and the phantom phreak   renoly santiago     who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible   hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi    oh   and as a little sub plot   dade also tries to woo acid burn   the only female hacker in the film    really   i can t think of much more to say about the film s plot aside from what i ve said    it s just a bunch of computer geeks   no   obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality   running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi    thanks to this movie   the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do    this movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time   and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list    to sum it up   hackers is a terrible computer film    if you re looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world   i suggest sneakers    although at times it too may seem a little far fetched   it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users    hopefully   this film didn t influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time    
Neg, if there s one thing i just can t stand   it s a film that oozes with sentimentality    here s a note to all film makers   films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves    swelling   saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy   and that the situation is hopeless    alas   my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up    what reminded me was that i wasn t choked up   or even the slightest bit moved   for that matter    my giant is a forced   contrived   and conspicuously un cute   i detest the word   cute   but i ve chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a   cute   film here      it takes a premise that might have been interesting   i liked the preview     and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches   all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience    maybe it will work for some people    it didn t work for me    billy crystal plays sam cayman   an agent who   at the beginning of the film   is in romania    he s in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film    the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired   get in a car accident   and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall    his name is max   gheorghe muresan     and sam thinks he d be a great movie star because of his size    subplots are as follows   sam has a son and a wife   kathleen quinlan     and he s never around for them   so they move to chicago    max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins    sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money   and so their various subplots can all be resolved    sam is broke    max is dying    pass the kleenex    my giant   as a comedy   is only moderately funny    it has its moments   the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself    in one great scene   sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal   of course   his son doesn t believe that he s actually speaking to seagal   and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is   i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect      crystal is always entertaining   and he has a few good lines here   some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely     often   however   he s countered by a slew of jokes that aren t funny   and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes    muresan is kind of fun to watch   but he just can t act very well    quinlan   on the other hand   is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents    she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown   but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff    here   the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent    all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that   for much of its running time   is simply mediocre    as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion   however   director michael lehmann   who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk   and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable   each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings    sam s multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed   how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family        later   it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam s reunion with his family    and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing   but i had a few morality problems with it   and i apologize for being vague      it s icky    it drips with gooey   wannabe human emotions    my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film    more importantly   it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is    instead   it s a complicated   overlong   and under engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears    and since it left me feeling completely unmoved   i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world    
Neg, this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash    this is more about a parable of greed   and how money can become the bane of your life    yes   there are elements of   fargo  here   the snow and cold     although not as vivid in the blood and gore department    it shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives    and how at the end of the day   the things that matter most are love   truth and honesty    although in one sense it may seem tedious   making a movie about the ugliness of greed   not box office material     it does become tedious   not because of the morale ending   but because one expects the movie to end that way    this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime   the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there    the characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk   brothers and friends   who all fall prey to the avarice of money    they should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible   level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance    commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton   whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful    bill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother   whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife   who indirectly causes the most problems    fill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars   and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath    it s not a simple plan   when you shoot everyone you love for money   unless you re the menendez brothers    
Neg, based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie   be happy   i won t bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons     this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box office   after scoring huge successes with men in black   7/10     directed by the same man who controlled this one   and independence day   6/10      can you say       the  third times not a charm    plot   james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation s top scientists   and threatening to take over the united states within a week    critique   i did not laugh once during this entire picture    when you consider that this film is a part comedy   that s not a very good sign    i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes    when you consider that the other   part   of this film is geared as an action/adventure   i would say that this another negative sign    and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow   the story line tired   reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving   and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one liners   weak characterizations and an anti climactic end   you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this   big   summer blockbuster    it blows    or as they say in french     eet blows      could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it    maybe    could it be that most of the special effects don t show up until the last half hour   and even then   we don t see anything that its trailers hadn t already given away    perhaps    or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big budget movies   that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own    naaaaaaah !  a bad movie is a bad movie    on a positive note   i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek   who seemed underused   in my humble opinion     and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in    branagh was also fun as the scenery munching   over the top bad guy   but that s pretty much where the entertainment buck stopped    smith and kline were static at best   the plot full of holes   and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others    i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie    then again   there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage       huh       oh  yeah   but the rest of the movie sucked    little known facts about this film and its stars   will smith has starred in two of the ten all time top grossing films worldwide   1997 s summer blockbuster men in black   7/10     for which he also recorded the grammy winning title song   and 1996 s independence day   6/10      he once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career    kevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama   and has been married to the cute as a button actress phoebe cates since 1989    they have two kids together   greta simone and owen    one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has   kasdan   written on it    lawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies   including the big chill   silverado   i love you to death   grand canyon and french kiss    salma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over   even though she spoke no english    she made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders  mi vida loca   no   not the rickie martin video !   and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez s desperado opposite antonio banderas    since then   she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez s films    she stands 5 2     was born in southeast mexico   and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother    one of the actresses cast as branagh s lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling   a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner   7/10      another is dutch born frederique van der wal   who is one of the world s most recognized supermodels   having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times   as well as harper s bazaar   vogue and mademoiselle    
Neg, in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa    the twilight murders   another one from the series   is dealing with the case of gordon kahl   played by rod steiger     old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u   s   government    after being released   he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest    when the u   s   marshals come to arrest him   it turns out that kahl isn t alone    many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti government beliefs   and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that    that brings fbi on the scene   and agent mayberly   michael gross   is supervising the manhunt    however   his efforts seem fruitless   since kahl still has many supporters   some of them even in the local law enforcement    after betrayed   1988 thriller by costa gavras   hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right wing extremism in the american northwest   and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing   when media hype brought right wingers back into spotlight    until that time   only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon    unfortunately   the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film   that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script    sometimes   like many american tv movies   it creates drama where drama shouldn t be    on the other hand   film is steadily directed by dick lowry   and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl    on the other hand   michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible    however   film does deal with potentially thought provoking social and political issues   so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn t be the total waste of time    
Neg,  * * * the following review contains spoilers * * *     it s just        the way        we are          a rapist   matt frewer   responds to supergirl s   helen slater   query as to why she s being attacked   an example of the mind numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl    i ll admit it        i love superman iii    i know it s hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor   but i still think it s a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise    supergirl   a spin off film of sorts from the series  same producers   alexander and ilya salkind     doesn t even rival superman iii in terms of quality   let alone superman or superman ii    supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time    as the film begins we see the residents of argo city   a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in   inner space     go about their daily lives    ok        what    so these are exiles from krypton   which blew up right    were they living there before krypton exploded    how do you get to   inner space      this whole   inner space   notion is never explained   particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world    how do they know where superman went    how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet    these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me    argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron    one day the founder of argo city   zaltar   peter o  toole     gives the omegahedron to superman s cousin   kara   helen slater     for use as inspiration in her art    kara uses it to create a bug like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of   whatever   that protects the city    in the chaos   the omegahedron sails out through the opening   dooming the argonians to death        in three days time   or something    kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world    the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor league witch named selena   faye dunaway   who   immediately before her dip was ruined   announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel   peter cook      selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans   and she sets out to achieve world domination    selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth   and that she s arrived as supergirl   complete with appropriate costume      supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives    ok        huh    why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake    attention movie   explain yourself !  i m sorry   i can only suspend disbelief so much    i can t buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to    knowing that she needs a secret identity   supergirl basically   wills   herself into a school girl outfit   complete with a different hairstyle     picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school    she s given her dorm assignment   and who happens to be her roommate    lois lane s sister   lucy    ok   coincidence is one thing folks   but we re getting really contrived now    what follows are some generic all girls school hijinks        complete with evil bully girls   mean for no reason   of course   and even a shower scene   !      best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks    at this point i m rapidly wondering why i m bothering with this nonsense    there is some credit to give to the film however    one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an   evil   bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its   prey   is very well done    also   its commendable to see genders reversed in the film   whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools    hart bochner   die hard   is particularly fun as kara s love interest   a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena   although he is unfortunately part of one of the film s more ridiculous moments   when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some   menacing   bumper cars      then there were numerous little things that bothered me    the flying effects are never convincing for a moment        it s all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires    instead of having her look like she s flying   the filmmakers wanted her to be   graceful     so she poses a lot and does ballet type maneuvers    also   who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth    a pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a   wacky   demise    there is also some rampant product placement in the film   most notably for popeye s   tylenol   and a&w root beer   with the latter actually putting its logo on the t shirt of one of the rapists     !      finally   just one word   monsters    faye dunaway and peter o toole ham it up unmercifully   however when o toole overacts he s entertaining and when dunaway does it she s annoying   her character actually says the line   seize them !    at one point      dunaway s henchmen   played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro   fare much better   with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty s otis character from the first two superman movies    helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent   naive character she s written to be   as she s able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable    believability aside though   it s still annoying    now despite all this negativity   and i m not alone here       supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles     leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested   but excited about its release on dvd !  they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd   to the delight of many people   including myself        yet i m still unclear as to why   since this movie is so awful      the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u   s   theaters    the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2   35   1   is enhanced for 16x9 televisions   and has been remastered in full thx glory    extras on the disc include   a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and   special project consultant   scott michael bosco   the excellent 50 minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl the making of a feature   dig that workout montage !     5 trailers   3 tv spots   talent bios   in depth storyboards   accompanied by score from the movie     and assorted still galleries    the transfer on this international version is incredible        you d think you were watching a new release    images are sharp   colors jump off the screen   and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts    only some special effects sequences show the wear of time   and there just isn t much that can be done about that   unless you re obsessive like george lucas      the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places   however you ll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score   which is completely unrelated to john williams  classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films  golan globus production      the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries    bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there s no dead air on the track    bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen   and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation    although   at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc   and is surprised when he doesn t get that response    we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track   most notably the   almost   appearance in the film by christopher reeve    great detail is given about superman s proposed role in the original script before reeve   wisely   dropped out    as it stands   superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission    for the sake of brevity   i won t even get into that one    szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds   and everyone else agreed   that supergirl needed to stand on its own   replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy   whimsical fantasy   nonsense    bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along   claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office    again   for the sake of brevity   i won t even get into that one    anchor bay has also released a limited edition   only 50   000 copies pressed   two disc set    disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release    disc two features the never before seen director s cut of the film   which runs 138 minutes long    the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don t add much of note   except for a few moments which lengthen peter o toole s screen time   particularly during his latter appearances      the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono   but fans of the film won t care    one question though        shouldn t the director s commentary be on the director s cut of the film    i d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd    i was nine when it was released to theaters   and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it    so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect    i knew the film wasn t beloved and i never had any interest in it before   but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc    as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence   which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong    come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo        so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started    at the end of the film   supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron   and flies back to argo city    ugh   i give up    i m surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once   not twice   but three times to review these discs    supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package   but a very lousy movie    [pg]  
Neg,    practical magic     is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap trap like this one    the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens   two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches   spanning back 200 years    at the start   their parents die when they are still children   and they go to live with their two zany aunts   stockard channing and dianne wiest      switch to the present day   gillian   who is the stronger   more rebellious sibling   leaves home   and meets up with a dark   abusive guy   goran visjnic     while sally stays in their hometown   meets and falls in love with a sweet   caring man   has two children   and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed   come to think of it   she s not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes      when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic   they accidentally murder him   and in desperation   bury the body in the backyard of their aunts  house    add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism   not to mention a spattering of   light hearted whimsy     and you have a pretty good idea how messy   practical magic   is    after seeing the film   i reflected that there was not even one scene   or element   that i liked or enjoyed    it is a comedy   to be sure   but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat   and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching    it is not charming or entertaining in any way    and then to top it off   we ve got this dark   but bird brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian s body    whatever    the characters are handled terribly   and actually   most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character    there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film   and in every scene involving them   they are always standing side by side    no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people    the same goes for aidan quinn   as a handsome police investigator   who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock   even though he comes into it at around the 70 minute mark   and once again   there is no attempt to develop their relationship   or his character   in any way    in fact   every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along   rather than getting to know the people saying the lines    i should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits   when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman   who managed to destroy the   batman   series with   batman forever   and   batman and robin         practical magic   is directed by griffin dunne   primarily an actor   who last year made the contrived   clumsy romance     addicted to love     with meg ryan and matthew broderick    i disliked that movie quite a bit   but since   practical magic   is even worse   that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is    i d tell him to quit while he s ahead   but in these last two years   he s ultimately already buried himself

Neg, note   some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers    be forewarned    i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science fiction flick species    squandering an intriguing premise   the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess   widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike    and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success   raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast   ben kingsley s a splendid actor   but a marquee name he ain t      miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film   i doubted that they d dare tempt fate and go for another round    so here comes species ii   with a new creative team   director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman   respectively   that fails to improve the series one iota    like its predecessor   species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid    the film follows the exploits of a young man   patrick ross   justin lazard     whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women   loitering in strip clubs   and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can    in other words   patrick is like a lot of guys   these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age   but there s a catch    he s an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars   and who s now infected with alien dna    patrick s overriding compulsion   to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring    and when he becomes aware of eve   natasha henstridge     a half human   half alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab   patrick s primary focus turns to her      if these two were to mate   the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable   warns dr   laura baker   marg helgenberger   gamely reprising her role   with admirable conviction    species ii opens with the mars mission   and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey looking   even splicing back to dated   grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities    they really skimped on production values this time around    however   this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick   watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship   any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b movie is quickly answered    mr   brancato s original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches    like the first film   and perhaps in homage to it     there s a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious    last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker s psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room      something bad happened here      this time   laura gets to stand over a fresh   shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter   this is awful      and she s not even empathic !  and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully paced suspense sequence   eve   who s telepathically linked to her alien/human hybrid counterpart   whatever     helpfully tells our alien hunting protagonists     he s going to rape her      while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious   at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own    there s an amusing   tongue in cheek bit of product placement   which doesn t really make much sense   but i appreciated the sentiment     as well as some supermarket related hijinx     he s in aisle 1 !    informs eve      if the film maintained this sort of light hearted tone   it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch   but   to its detriment   it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody   effects ladened anticlimactic conclusion    much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense   and there are such gaping plot holes that it s terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief    the implausibilities are endless   what about the toxic bomb in eve s brain    why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual    my favourite was the slow motion sequence in the film where eve   sporting superhuman strength   is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks    this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief   incredulous that it s being foisted upon the public    returning headlines michael madsen   who reprises tough guy press lennox   and ms   helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay   but there s realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis    mykelti williamson   portraying astronaut dennis gamble   churns out an all too familiar spin on a generic brash mouthed character   and fine character actors george dzundza   playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process   and james cromwell   patrick s neglectful father   senator ross   are utterly wasted in the film    mr   lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty eyed look   while returning vixen ms   henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene   and acquits herself nicely     but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing   or none at all      ms   henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series   claiming that   she s so empowered      a lethal half alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion    now * that s * what i call empowerment    
Neg, the sequel to the fugitive   1993     u   s marshals is an average thriller using it s association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks    tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard   the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive    this time   he s after fugitive mark sheridan   snipes   who the police think killed two fbi agents   but of course he s been set up   and when the police plane escort he   and gerard   are riding crashes   he makes a run for it   gerard not so hot on his tail    what follows is about 2 hours of action   brought to us by the director of executive decision   1995     another film curiously involving a plane    when comparing this movie to the fugitive   the prequel is far superior    but even on it s own   u   s marshals is a pretty lousy movie    while the original was reasonably intelligent   and had a fugitive to root for   the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive   mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film s overlong running time    while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character   u   s marshals is straight in there   pulling it s trump card   the place crash   almost immediately    to be honest   i couldn t care less if snipe s character got captured or not    snipes performance is average   and his character gets surprisingly little screen time   considering he is the fugitive   for reasons i ll explain later    tommy lee jones is as fine as ever   although his role is hardly a challenge    the sense of deja vu was overwhelming    i know it s the same role from the fugitive   but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film    there s a few  nudge nudge  references from the first film   but apart from that   nothing    nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie    downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who s roped into the chase   and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife    nobody looks as if their having a good time   and all the performers are on autopilot    the supporting cast are o   k   but when it comes to performances   u   s marshals falls flat on it s face    it doesn t fare any better plot wise   either    the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes   but then veers off into terrorists territory    as said above   the film is an normal   average terrorist thriller   seen a million times before   but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional    if this film wasn t the  sequel  to the fugitive   this would probably go straight to video   or not even been made at all   because it s so average    and because of the film s plot changing it s course   snipes is almost forgotten apart   and hardly features in the movie    stuart baird   the director   is all right   but there s no particular scene that stands out    it s director is the usual action movie style    even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension    the special effects are nice   especially the plane crash   and there s a good   if very loud   soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith    but in the end   u   s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement    sure   it s loud and dumb   but in the end u   s marshals just ain t fun    bored performers and a lackluster plot and script   do not make a good action movie    overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities  
Neg, one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton s 1925 silent film seven chances    now i ve never seen seven chances   as i m more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan   but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this    o donnell plays jimmie shannon   the manager of a pool table manufacturing company    he also fears commitment   and despite dating anne   renee zellweger   for over three years   he s unwilling to marry her    his reasons    well he s a guy you see   and well   guys are like stallions   and they apparently don t like to be roped or something   hey   that s the movie s explanation        i d marry renee zellweger in a second      eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose   and when he does   it s the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever    he essentially says to her     you win   and hands her a ring    the audience should now hate this character    i did    then the meat of the plot presents itself    jimmie s grandfather   peter ustinov   completely wasted   dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business    however   in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers   jimmie must be married before his next birthday   which is just over 24 hours away      having blown his chances with anne   jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a   business proposition      the movie wasn t half bad by this time   surprisingly    it wasn t boring me   and even managed to read my thoughts at one point    ustinov s character left a video will   and while he s reading the ridiculous clause in it   i thought to myself   what is this   brewster s millions        as soon as i thought it   hal holbrook s character actually says   what is this   brewster s millions      it was quite surreal    something happens though during the film s final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive    up to that point   all of jimmie s prior girlfriends had turned down his   business proposition   which i felt was good    at least the film wasn t painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers    when jimmie has no other options   his goofy friend   played by artie lange   making a career out of playing the goofy friend   places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story    at this point   100   000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride    these women arrive at jimmie s location and immediately start bullying him about what he s looking for in a woman    when he s had enough of their unjustified attacks   he tells the angry mob that there s been a mistake and he won t be marrying any of them    as a result   the women proceed to chase him around the city   in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off    this goes on for the rest of the film    it s just chris o donnell running from 100   000 obnoxious   greedy   angry and stupid women    my groans of disgust could be heard for miles    the film finally ended   thankfully     but to this day i m still groaning    the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video    it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1   85   1   cast and crew info   and special dvd rom features    the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc   which contains scenes not in the film    apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o donnell around the city   and at one point o donnell is leaping from the tops of buses    so that was bad enough to be cut   but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good    ugh    
Neg, the happy bastard s quick movie review  holy man  more like holy crap    the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs   jeff goldblum and kelly preston   with a flat tire on their hands    somehow he ends up in their car and on their channel   a line up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white   morgan fairchild   and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures    it s here that he seems to hit his stride   speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales    at this point in the movie   of course   morality comes into play   particularly on goldblum   who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss   robert loggia      it doesn t take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush   with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points    only a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild s face seems to have any interest in the movie    murphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he d rather be someplace else    some may argue that the movie has a message   but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat    at least he has something for us to laught at        
Neg, forget get carter    instead        get me a cup of coffee    what the hell has happened to all good american action movies    did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere    when did all of the bad ass   kicking butt and taking names   gun toting   crazed   vengeful characters of the 1980 s    from such films as commando   cobra   predator   raw deal   first blood    suddenly turn into innocent   compassionate   sensitive   teary eyed knuckleheads    the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east    and i don t mean new york city    get carter    the latest masterpiece from uber thespian sylvester stallone    is a prime example of large and in charge 80 s action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown    stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up    a few years ago   stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey    that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland    a strange film about redemption within a broken soul    stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past    too bad get carter returns stallone to action   but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges    get carter is a simple story    stallone plays frank carter   a vegas bruiser for a loan shark   played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore      when frank s brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident   frank   feeling all guilty and mushy inside   thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented   carter s way      he talks tough with his brother s wife   lends a helping had to his brother s daughter doreen   rachel leigh cook     and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee    carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra cool   mcqueen esque mickey rourke   a multi millionaire computer geek   alan cumming     and a strange foreign guy   michael caine   who speaks in riddles and talks tough    carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties    what a minute !  this sounds just like another film i saw last year   the limey    better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off    actually   get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name   starring caine in the title role   and what with his cameo here   the cleverness is astonishing      while stallone still carries his own weight here   the movie lacks what the original did as well   purpose    throughout the film   stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough   while nobody is taking him seriously    his one liners fall flat   and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions   mental and physical   required of his character    there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations    in both fists and words    the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke    an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs   spousal abuse   a boxing career   and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way   rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character    he may not win any oscars   but he still ranks highly in my book    get carter has great directing   strong acting by rourke and caine   and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud    the only thing it lacks   as with most hollywood productions    is a good script and proper casting    never mind that it should never have been made at all

Neg, what would you do if no one could see you    well   if you re a super smart bio molecular research scientist working for the military   you d grope a co worker and rough up your neighbor from across the street    that s right    of all the non criminal possibilities brought about by rendering oneself invisible   in   hollow man   kevin bacon s character opts to commit sex crimes    er   it s kevin bacon who plays the super smart military bio molecular research scientist    something sounds horribly wrong already    but this is a paul verhoeven film   and the sleazepin director of such open crotch classics as   basic instinct   and the infamous   showgirls   never lets a little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic tendencies which   when you come right down to it   is all this film is about       hollow man   features a string of hapless   c list actors   among them bacon   elisabeth shue   josh brolin   and kim dickens   in a grade z plot with a lot of special effects that   frankly   don t look much better than those used in the 1933 version of   the invisible man      oh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he s attempting reentry but otherwise it s lots of   thermal   shots and inanimate objects   elisabeth shue included   bobbing around without any visible signs of support    since invisibility   once achieved   isn t much of an effect   the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each other  it amounts to much of a muchness     the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in loosely buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon s character gets invisible he can head straight for them    it s as if that fascinating concept  what would you do if no one could see you     is  simply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin    as a horror film     hollow man   is unsophisticated and disturbing   in its intent   not its achievements   and not worth your time or your hard earned dollars    it s minor verhoeven  and even that s not saying much  and boy is it hollow    
Neg, roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast     who would have guessed that the most savage mad dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by        ben kingsley      my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark   henry fonda in once upon a time in the west   or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it    they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild   sympathetic   or even ineffectual character roles    the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious    that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast    gary   gal   dove   played by ray winstone   has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain    life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing    but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one two punch    the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa    the second punch comes from gal s past    back in london gang boss teddy bass   ian mcshane   tv s lovejoy   is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal    he sends his most rabid henchman don logan   ben kingsley   to fetch gal    don will accept any decision gal makes from   yes   to   certainly      however   if gal says   no   don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy s ex porn  star wife deedee   amanda redman      in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody s skin    kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness    there are some serious problems in louis mellis s and david scinto s script that should have been caught before filming    when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success    beyond an ability to use skin diving gear   no special talents are required of him    any local hood could have done what gal is needed for    additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault   flooding the vault    no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether   but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool    in spite of the provocative title   the story is cliched and overly familiar    i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade    the story is usually of the reformed outlaw   a robert taylor type   who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability    the old gang   however   wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git   im    it is not a great plot    in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards    perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film    it is an old plot dressed up to look new    if the plot is old   at least the style is creative    this is director jonathan glazer s first film   but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout    his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences    cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes    we see one side of a person s faces    but the other side fades into the darkness   a sort of metaphor for the half world these characters in habit    half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden    us yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog    at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking   the heavy accents   and the cockney language    sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre   the london crime film    the plot may be new to british crime films   but it would be overly familiar as a western    further respectability comes from ben kingsley s high powered performance    i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the  4 to +4 scale    
Neg, apparantly money talks            and uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so !  i ve always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess   whether in language   violence   sex   or what have you    i find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard   and money talks definitely does !  it s not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly   and i mean constantly !     but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged    perhaps if one character were foul mouthed   but in this film   everybody swears nearly every other word    money talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett   played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker      franklin is your typical con man and ends up with more than one person out to get him    when the plot finally gets underway   there s no less than three people   or groups   that want him   dead or alive    the frenchman who s somewhat responsible for franklin s escape from a prisoner packed bus   a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand   and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder    franklin s only hope   james russell   charlie sheen     an investigative reporter for the local news who s out to prove himself a worthy journalist    james offers to help clear franklin s name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week    both of these elements are completely lost along the way however   and never do reappear    as expected   the odd couple of franklin and james do wind up friends at the end   which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way    there is just nothing original or intriguing about this film   and so many developments are either non relevant   or just plain forgotten about    money talks is a paint by numbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience    frivilous dialogue   a predictable   flat storyline   and two dimensional characters make money talks a reason to save your money    
Neg, starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king   the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics   but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public  particularly kids   wanted to see    therefore   it s with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas    despite some innovation and risk taking   the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes   as are its characters    a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the   savages   that live there    the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust    only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash    the ending   as it turns out   is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film s finer moments    the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth    governor ratcliffe   for instance   is a snobbish   single minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses    captain john smith is a blond hunk who   while   slightly   misguided   is good at heart    pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time    she even comes complete with insignificant best friend    again   against tradition   talking animals aren t used   but a lusty   wizened   talking tree is    this is an odd compromise   but it s one of the few elements that really work    the animals are a delight   and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation    maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes    the talking tree   who seems to have a thing for john smith   is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch    the music   a welcome delight in the later disney films   is mostly a let down here   with the exception of the catchy and motivational     colors of the wind      mel gibson   as the voice of john smith   has a solid singing voice and should have been used more    the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs   the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character    i was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time    even the children in the audience seemed restless    while there s no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want  or disney wants them to  most i believe will be disappointed    perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history    it s all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie s entertainment value   but doing so to historical facts doesn t work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer s minds and plot holes that are never filled    even the artwork   another disney strong point   varies greatly in quality   making any story problems even more obvious    as mentioned above   there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film    for instance   if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with   savages     why did he so quickly change his previous   kill as many indians as i can   attitude    if he was such a nice guy after all   he should have changed his ways long before this    or how about pocahontas  amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men    i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience   but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot   history was modified in the film anyway    as it is   i wonder if it doesn t give kids the wrong impression    in short   the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set    while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions   they end up failing on too many levels    
Neg, plot   upon the realization that they are failing all of their classes   two roommates try to find a third roomie who will kill himself   since the school s charter automatically grants top grades to the roommates of any student who succeeds in suicide    critique   despite this film s interesting premise and dark subject matter   this movie sucks because it is unfunny   boring   and presents us with one of tom everett scott s worst acting performances    add that to a completely unsuccessful romance element   many lame and corny jokes   a long wait for the setup   and an ending that takes all the blackness out of this   black comedy     if you re gonna create a black comedy   don t chicken out in the end see very bad things   8/10   for a perfect example     and you ve got yourself a trite mtv creation worthy of its own subject matter    i barely laughed at any gags   found the bong element contrived and repetitive   and was horrified not to find any gratuitous nudity tossed anywhere in this movie   if you re gonna make a bad college comedy   at least slap in some free t&a shots for the kids        this one s not even worth the rental   fellas    skip it altogether !  little known facts about this film and its stars   during auditions for that thing you do !   tom everett scott s first feature film role   director tom hanks was opposed to hiring tom because of the fact that scott could ve passed for hanks 15 years ago    it wasn t until hanks  wife rita wilson saw the audition tape   and decided he was cute   that hanks decided to risk hiring scott    the actor who played scott cooper in this film   mark paul gosselaar   is best known for having played the character of zack morris on tv s   saved by the bell      his parents are dutch and named hans and paula    and who would ve guessed that this is director alan cohn s first shot at directing a feature film    
Neg, when respecting a director   you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect    woody allen has made a couple less than good films   and he s my favorite    even martin scorsese hasn t had a perfect track record    kevin smith   after a smashing debut with the classic   clerks   stooped as low to sell out and make the dreadful   mallrats      i mean   so far the only director who s made several films   none of which have been bad is richard linklater     slacker       dazed and confused       before sunrise     and   suburbia         all  which were great      now   i adore quentin tarantino    his first two films were classic films   the second one being one of the greatest films of all time    but 1995 just wasn t that good of a year for him    he made way too many tv appearances    he mispronounced jackie chan s name on the mtv movie awards    and he made this film       he was also awarded an oscar   so i guess that would be a grand exception      robert rodriguez is also a great director   not a brilliant one   but a cool one    i ve never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film   so i can t comment on them    but in this crap ensemble director s film   all four give pitiful efforts    pitiful for any director   too    now in all fairness   ensemble director pieces never really work out    i ve never seen all of   new york stories     but have heard the first two films   by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap   i saw woody s one   which was hilarious but not totally up to par     but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film    exposition   a simple one   a bellhop   ted   the totally overdone tim roth   who s a god and all   but not in this one   though he has a couple good moments   is working on new year s eve for his first shift   ! ! !   in an old fancy hotel    he s the only one there   again   ! ! !   and he only has a couple rooms   yet again   ! ! !      the old bellhop   the seemingly immortal marc lawrence   who hated pulp fiction actually   hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily    as the night goes on   he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile    yea       the short films are presented in order   btw      the missing ingredient writer/director   allison anders starring   sammi davis   amanda decadenet   valeria golino   madonna   ione skye   lili taylor   alicia witt  this one starts it off horribly with no plot   no intrigue   and crap dialogue    the situation is so terrible that it s physically painful to watch    the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is   gasp !    stuck inside some object in their hotel room    the witch that was supposed to bring it   ione skye   calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it    yeah   that s what i said    stupid plot   inane characters who aren t interesting at all   etc   etc   etc   the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which   in turn   it wastes pitifully    not even actually funny for a second    my rating   out of 5     no stars ! ! ! !  the wrong man writer/director   alexandre rockwell starring   david proval   jennifer beals and laurence bender  another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on    ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple   david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at   coming back     who are playing sex games    ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon    but at least this has a bit of comedy in it   just not that much    and david proval has never overacted as much    and it s   pulp fiction   producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window    a masterpiece compared to the first one   but still        the misbehavers writer/director   robert rodriguez starring   antonio banderes   tamlyn tomita   lana mckissack   danny verduzco   salma hayek  would a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek s navel    nope    luckily she s on the tv dancing so we get to see her    surprisingly enough   when i read the screenplay   about a year before actually seeing it     this one seemed to have the most potential    it was fast paced   funny   and well   funny    but when i watched it   it seemed anti climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once    antonio overacts nicely and the two kids   lana and danny   are funny    but   as i said   it moves slowly and in that way   it s more painful than funny    but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time    oh !  the plot   antonio is a supposed gangster   assumed   really   who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife   tomita   go out to get drunk at a new year s party    antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long   but things go wrong       it  was okay    the man from hollywood writer/director   quentin tarantino starring   quentin tarantino   bruce willis   paul calderon and jennifer beals   again    ironically   this one could be considered the best for a bad reason   it best represents what quentin has done with this film    he plays chester   a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row    they re drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn t light    they also pay him a lot of cash    this is so much exactly what this little film is about that it s campy    tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves  cause they ve had hits   major or minor    it took quentin to realize that    but the thing is   it doesn t seem like he realizes that    if he did   i d give this a good 3 stars    but this sucked    it was anti climactic and the dialogue wasn t very good    he starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes    that makes no sense    it s cool for a while   then he makes it uneven    it s long and it s just not very good    hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one    conclusion   what s the moral here    if you ve made celebrated films   don t do an ensemble piece    they should have re watched   new york stories   and then stopped in their tracks    none of these have any point to them and they re embarrassing to not only the writer/directors   but to the actors  cause they re working with crap    but i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentin s next directing job   even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool   from dusk till dawn     which i found exhilerating      i love quentin and i suppose it s good he made   the man from hollywood   because it makes him seem more realistic and not some   god of cinema      i seem to respect directors if they aren t   gods   and are actually human beings who make mistakes       the man from hollywood   is his big mistake and let s hope he doesn t return her continuously    
Neg, you don t need to have seen the original   species   to appreciate how utterly lousy   species ii   is    with few exceptions   sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them   but the fact that   species ii   is a follow up isn t the only reason it s so miserable    it s the predictable storyline   the cardboard characters   the banal dialogue   the failed attempts at humor   the revolting special effects   the gratuitous nudity   all female   of course     the bad acting   and the bland direction    the plot   simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc   involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle    the slime   well   sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black    that should have been the end of the movie right there    back on terra firma   at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and   as you ll remember if you saw the first movie   driven by a strong urge to procreate    on a parallel track   government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film   now called eve   again   played   by natasha henstridge   and are keeping her around for some testing    this   apparently   includes observing eve s reaction to   the dukes of hazzard   tv show   which she appears to enjoy    eve s bio rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk   mates     which we are forced to witness in gross out detail   but otherwise there doesn t appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film   unless it was written into her contract   let s hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only      eve finally breaks free of her confines  and her bra  for the finale   but the effects are so messy you can t really see what s going on    peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams   i told  em not to go !    at the top of his lungs   referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle    michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox   so that he can enter high security areas   flash a badge and claim to be press   maybe       as does marg helgenberger as dr   laura baker   the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns    they re both unbelievably wooden    what s a talented filmmaker like peter medak     the ruling class       the krays       let him have it     doing directing this tripe   i wonder    it s an unfortunate trend   this   once talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like   species ii      last year peter hyams gave us   the relic     no thanks necessary there    and the first   species   was helmed by roger donaldson who   although certainly no genius behind the camera   had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects    is it just that there are no better offers out there       species ii   is worthless    worse than that   it s also exploitative   offensive   and insulting to the intelligence at every turn    it s not that there isn t anything positive to say about the film    there is    after 92 minutes   it ends    
Neg,    something is fishy in the state of universal      about ten years back   with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior   post apocalypse nitty gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies    we ve always had movies of this nature   on the beach   the end of the world   damnation alley   the ultimate warrior   and so on    to date   the most smoothly done were straightforward   haircuts   of the classic western plot   like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization   usually one in possession of some critical resource   like water   feed range   or a mining claim    most of these grew out of venerable   but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane       my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn   which was fairly well made on a small budget      now we have waterworld   which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter       well   she s not a widow   and the kid isn t her daughter   but you get the idea      the lady is helen   played by the stunning jean tripplehorn   who isn t given a chance to be stunning   or even interesting   by the mediocre and unimaginative script    the child enola   played by tina majorino   is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie   she outshines her material all the way through    in simple   the scene is earth   hundreds of years from now    the polar ice caps have melted   and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet    the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies   and survive by trade   theft   or piracy    somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries   and its inhabitants   called   smokers     are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials   so the bad guys have outboard engines   and fast moving boats   airplanes   and jet skis    enola   found at sea as a young girl   has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back    we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical   dryland     the place where trees   crops   and animals grow   and what plot there is hinges on who has enola    the psycho ruler of the smokers   the   deacon     is trying to get her and find his way to dryland    played with typical self lampooning   rug chewing histrionics by dennis hopper     deacon   is the only thing in the movie that s close to amusing    his performance is * almost * laughable   but there just isn t enough there to be funny    the star   and a co producer   is kevin costner    he s playing an un named lone denizen of the sea   a man called the   mariner     who turns out to be a gilled   water breathing mutant with webbed feet    very little is done with this    the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism   it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted   much of the earth s surface would still be above water   and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown       canned meat does * not * last for centuries   ammunition does * not * fire after it s more than a few decades old   and so on   and so on          i m quite fond of tina majorino s previous work   very impressed by jean tripplehorn s past accomplishments   and still speechless over costner s dances with wolves    but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it !  this movie cost one hundred and eighty two million dollars   and there s * nothing * in it we haven t seen before   done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey    at 125 minutes of material   this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make    the budget of this movie * could * have given us over thirty movies   it could have paid for six years of a prime time sf tv series with expensive fx work   or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx    in sum   this movie is beneath contempt    it has nothing new to offer   it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc   and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation    if you * have * to go see it   see it on a four dollar matinee    otherwise you ll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface   for weeks    
Neg, this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation    but lo and behold   here comes   switchback     and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as   kiss the girls   and   i know what you did last summer      but   switchback   is an undoubtedly weak genre entry   as the material it covers is old and tired   and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting       switchback   opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she s watching    we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse   dennis quaid     and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while    he is promptly removed from the case   but this conflict of interest doesn t keep him from offering pursuit    lacrosse s most recent trek takes him to a blood soaked hotel room in amarillo   texas   where the local sheriff   r   lee ermey   is torn between his re election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man    in a related aside   former railway worker bob goodall   danny glover   is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup plastered   even on the seatbelts   el dorado    along the way   he picks up    and subsequently saves the life of    hitchhiking loner lane dixon   jared leto      this tangent isn t a random one   as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself    or is the villain in fact lacrosse   only pretending to be after the cold hearted murderer he knows so much about    in a sense   that s half of the basic problem with   switchback      for its first hour   the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator   so we re given little insight into who they are   likely for fear that we ll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction    but   switchback   then decides to explicitly reveal the killer s identity at its midpoint   and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense    some of the acting is a burdensome area as well   probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves    what is danny glover doing here   grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot    and dennis quaid       that monotone    stop it !    ermey is solid in a supporting role that s more interesting than the two leads thrown together   but the charismatic leto   claire danes  object of affection in   my so called life     is a scene stealer tried and true    >from a material standpoint     switchback   is pretty empty    but even when first time director jeb stuart   who wrote   the fugitive   and   die hard     doesn t know what to do   he knows what he wants it to look like    the movie provides some great visuals    the set on a train climax looks good   even though the action is illogical     and the beautiful   crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor    still   that s not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond   and more than the movie s look will end up leaving you cold

Neg, some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others   almost as gifted   have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable    as was amply evident after basic instinct   sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon    rejecting her natural abilities   she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type    gloria is her latest disaster    babe ruth didn t quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity   and neither should stone reject what she does best    janeane garofalo   for example   is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone s part in basic instinct   neither is stone any less talented because she couldn t do garofalo s comedic roles    gloria   directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes   was not screened in advance for critics   almost always a sign that the studio isn t behind the picture    after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened   it is clear why they held it from the press    it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed    as the story opens   an angry gloria   stone   is being released from prison after 3 years confinement    she s got a bad attitude and a big mouth    she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents   a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast    an annoying child actor named jean luke figueroa plays a soon to be orphan named nicky    just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria s ex boyfriend kevin   jeremy northam     nicky s dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin s operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice       be a man     his father lectures him sternly       don t trust nobody    not no broads    nobody      most of the film s leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of the automated time and temperature announcements    add in the movie s almost non existent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing   and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones    lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting    they stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse         say you re my baby     kevin coos demandingly       i m not gonna     gloria pouts back      the movie has a plethora of logical flaws and implausibilites    the kid rarely seems the least bit worried or scared   no matter how many people are after him with guns   trying to kill him    and in one key scene   the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it and is further assumed never to have been copied    gloria   who keeps saying how she hates kids   takes nicky under her wing and protects him from kevin and the bad guys    think her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends    if you don t know the answer   you may be just the right viewer for this film    you have to say this for stone   she can keep a straight face    when explaining life to a 7 year old kid   she says with utter seriousness     you got a lot of love making to make   you got a lot of boozing to do      gloria runs 1   48    it is rated r for profanity   violence and brief male nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers

Neg, i never understood what the clich     hell on earth   truly meant until very recently    i ve just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying   so horrible   so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as   hell on earth      after all   i ve never been to war   i ve never been the victim of any violent crime   i ve never really been broken hearted   and i ve never been audited   so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was   hell on earth    then i saw cruel intentions    in a perfect world   i would be in charge of all the movie studios    the very first thing i d do in this perfect world   would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a 20 something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv   and throw them in jail    but it wouldn t just be your average jail   not even a maximum security installation    i d have these producers   and everyone else involved in the production of these films   put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity    now you re probably thinking to yourself     is this really how bad cruel intentions is      the answer is no    it s actually much worse    watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumble s awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound    and then pouring acid on the salt    i don t know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum   tara reid   whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet   but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom    from that opening scene   where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz   to the conclusion which i don t remember because i had practically fallen asleep   cruel intentions is truly   hell on earth     right up there with war and tax audits    
Neg, about an hour or so into   the jackal     a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence   and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out   i hope she gets killed now !    at that point it hit me   i didn t care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn t really like    when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he s being played by sidney poitier   you know something s rotten in the state of denmark    every year   a couple films like this are released    you know   the cheap   action packed international espionnage film   featuring a semi promising premise   some big name actors   usually bruce willis     and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago    this was the third one of  97   following the very lackluster   the saint     which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe   and the surprisingly fun   the peacemaker     featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain       the jackal   tries to mix both elements    and you thought   the saint   was bad       the jackal   is loosely   very loosely   i hope   based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i ve yet to see     the day of the jackal     which featured   apparently   a suave hitman called the jackal   played by edward fox   trying to assasinate charles degaule    well   welcome to the 90s   where a sorta suave hitman   also called the jackal   bruce willis     trying to kill the head of the fbi       or  is he    after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother   killed in the opening scenes     the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere   from helsinki to virginia   setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he ll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion    and like the saint   the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people    the agent working on the case   cater preston   sidney poitier   yes   that sidney poitier     working with a russian agent   valentina koslova   diane venora   lady capulet from   romeo + juliet       gives up early on and meets with an ex ira man   declan mulqueen   richard gere   putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of  97   who s in a massachusetts jail   but who has apparently seen the jackal   who has been eluding the law forever    soon   he s out working with the two untrusting agents   and trying to help them catch him    there are numerous problems with the film   and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on    the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller   but save a couple moments   the film never achieves suspense   or even a sense of intrigue    sure   the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense   but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register    the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience   or even an entertaining one    it doesn t help that the plot is designed to be complex   but falls into so many problems   like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances    the script of   the jackal   is a complete mess   mostly because it can t decide what it wants to focus on    is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer    is it a film about a nasty   amoral hitman who s in everything for the money    or is it a combination of both       the jackal   aims for the latter   but never focuses in on either character    the connection between the two feels completely edited   so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan   you wonder how he recognized him so fast    the worst part is the little past they try to give declan   most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend   isabella   mathilda may     given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then    the supporting characters are worse    sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role   that of a man who is just stern sometimes   and other times more giving and likable    what is poitier doing here    he s one of the best living actors !  does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this    diane venora s russian character is almost as bad   with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth   and a plastered on expressionless facade    it s not that anyone s bad here   it s that they have nothing to do    the plot is a joke   feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time    the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain    there are several times where he s in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself   the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill    take a scene where he s being followed by some agents into a parking garage   he quickly sprays his car another color   and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it    doesn t killing someone attract more attention than it does distract    and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place    geez !  is there anything good here    well       a  couple things    i did like willis s icy expressions   he may not have been real suave or anything   but some of his looks are worth a chuckle    richard gere has a couple of good moments   making his character as likable as he possibly could have    and a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous   completely inane but fun kinda way   most notably   a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder   jack black     and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man   which has its share of a couple good jokes   most particular a kiss by willis    but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go   they re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is   the jackal      director michael caton jones   who directed the far superior   rob roy     has made a film that is made very couple months   one that is unentertaining   unintriguing   and pretty much cold   but will nevertheless make money because   hey   the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro clancy kinda way    every now and then   the filmmakers get it right     clear and present danger     which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way     but   the jackal   is an example of when they go completely wrong    
Neg,    showgirls   is the first big budget   big studio film to receive an nc 17 rating    and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence    but if   showgirls   is any indication of hollywood s future   the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values  bad moviemaking       showgirls   is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene   and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter    director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas   who collaborated on another shock value project   1992 s   basic instinct     follow the plight of a young woman   teen tv star elizabeth berkley   determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer    it s a hackneyed premise to begin with   so not surprisingly   all of the stock characters are trucked out    there s the demanding producer    the loyal friend    the bitchy competitor    lest i forget the scummy club owner    of course   any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film s main attraction  an endless parade of full frontal nudity    unfortunately     showgirls   doesn t satisfy in this department    verhoeven s slam bang   in your face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic    to make matters worse   you ll be forced to sit through the movie s clothed scenes   which don t cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history    verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground   but if it s adult entertainment you want   stay home and watch the playboy channel    you ll be the wiser for it    
Neg, here s a concept    jean claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie    now if that isn t enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie   i don t know what is    all sarcasm aside   it is certainly a different way to start a movie   of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother    so lucky us   we get to see more of jean claude    van damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives    van damme #2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france    the remaining twin   the french cop   goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death    once there   he hooks up with his deceased brother s girlfriend   played by natasha henstridge   and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are    jean claude s acting abilities don t seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie    in other words   just in case you missed the sarcasm   his acting is worse than normal    on the upside   natasha henstridge is in this film   and she does what she did best in species    she gets naked    sadly   this is probably the high point in the movie    she is actually a decent actress   but didn t improve as much as i thought she would after species    this is the typical van damme movie   with jean claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents    nothing new here   and certainly nothing we haven t seen in every other van damme movie    simply put   there is absolutely nothing new about this movie    it has a retread plot    this isn t the first time jean claude has played twins    he still can t act    we all saw natasha s breasts in species   although this is one repeat performance i m not complaining about      this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in    sub par    
Neg, what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable   lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project    most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films    john frankenheimer   who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60 s   recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin    screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd    ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room   and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes    even charlize theron   who i was convinced couldn t act   did a decent job in cider house rules    when all of these bright stars come together   one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining    after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games   disbelief was my first reaction   then frustration    the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining    the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull   i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are    it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights    we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set   it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar    the actors in that movie were having fun and   from that   the audience had fun    reindeer games is the complete opposite   the actors don t seem to want to be their characters   even danny trejo   who will do practically anything   doesn t look like he is enjoying himself     causing the audience to quickly lose interest    evidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled   boy this movie is horrible !    and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments    the story follows a man   rudy   ben affleck     who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick   james frain      nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman   ashley   charlize theron     and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person    when nick is killed in a prison riot   rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays    unfortunately ashley s brother   gabriel   gary sinise   interferes with their relationship    thinking rudy is nick   he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino   which nick use to work at as a security guard    now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel    confused    the movie only gets more complex as it goes on   until it gets way   way too complex at its climax    but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour    the hero commits a greedy   selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley    some hero    the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing   a person for the audience to relate to or admire    when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble   instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys   i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times    the most irritating part of the film   besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february   is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason    the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays   especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead    the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food    why he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me    why any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me    
Neg,    dreamworks skg   running time   2 hours starring robert duvall   tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year   the second is the macho armageddon   is actually a dull affair    elijah wood plays leo biederman   who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth    tea leoni plays a   rather crap   news reporter   jenny lerner   who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way   and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew   spurgeon tanner   who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth    also featuring is morgan freeman as the president   and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny s father and mother    while many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up   as the trailers seem to promise     the film is actually more of a character study   if a very poor one    the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film   and not enough time to explore them all    only the space crew are given any depth   jenny lerner   leo and the president are surprisingly 2d   and we never get to know these characters    and because i couldn t care for them   i didn t really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not    the script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple   and never really makes any interesting statements    mimi leder   the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker   1996     again directs in a ho hum style   and never really gets any emotion out of a scene   which is a shame    the cast are seemingly on autopilot   although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance   even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good    she seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist    robert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role   he just seems to be in this film for the money    elijah wood   one of the best child actors working today   is surprisingly average   although his choice of roles lately haven t exactly been brilliant   i   e    flipper   1996      his role is also vastly underwritten    morgan freeman   again   is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role    like duvall   he just seems to be in the film for the money    the supporting cast are all o   k   none making much of an impression    ok   so deep impact may have messed up character wise   but surely the special effects are good    well   yes and no    although the special effects should be impressive   with a massive tidal wave destroying new york   the special effects look like   well   special effects    sadly   the waves looks like it s been drawn on computer   and doesn t look too good at all    surprising really   when the effects are done by industrial light & magic   who did the effects for the lost world and twister    in the end   deep impact is a wasted opportunity    what could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects    the 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect    once again   dreamworks has churned out another average movie    let s hope armageddon is a bit better    overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities  
Neg, seen may 2   1998 at 3   40 p   m   at the crossgates cinema 18   theater #13   with chris wessell and sean o shea for $5    [theater rating   * * * 1/2   very good sound   picture   and seats]  the big budget   mega hype   event   movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one    gluttony is hollywood s favorite sin   but it is the movie goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever worsening basis       lost in space   is the latest such offering   a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre    it s made up of every element of science fiction   but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for    audiences  attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films   this one opens with a fast paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film   probably because it has   star wars   written all over it     but as the producers  way of showing off their budget through the special effects    battle scenes are worthless without tension   and since we have no idea what the setting is it s impossible to care about anything that happens    in essence   the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game   not a piece of filmmaking    we meet the robinson family   a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth s behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources    each member of the family has a special trait and personality   and yet none of them seem like actual people    professor john robinson   hurt   is the intelligent   quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it   it s obvious what role this aspect will play      of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other   while the necessary problems are   resolved   at the right moments    the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it s presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire   and is so pathetic it s laughable    the first act is not a building of a story   but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements   such as plot   conflict   and characterization   god forbid !      we re provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent    in fact   it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non existent    yes   the characters do speak   but they do not talk    they say things that only relate to the conflict   but they never really interact   unless it s the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west   leblanc   and uptight   unemotional judy robinson   graham        it s amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens    eventually the pacing rapidly increases   but the amount of genuine interest does not    the story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr   smith   oldman     the cartoony villain   and his plans for sabotage    what ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts    the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as   alien    lite    the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive    but there s never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly    plotlines are developed   but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario    the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes   but it s presented in such a ridiculous way it s utterly boring    by the time the last act rolls around   there is no sense of a payoff building    the ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax   instead   it seems to come to a sudden halt   but at least it ends at all         lost in space   is major film production at its worst    it s frightening that a film so poorly written   directed   and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment    
Neg, the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could ve been effective    such is the case with  urban legend    the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks    the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends    examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house    the killer wears one of those l   l   bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up   so you can t see the face    i guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days    anyhow   the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric    it s a very good setup that promises more chills to come    unfortunately   the film never takes off from there    the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus    like most slasher flicks   this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac   or in this case an axe wielding maniac      i ve always wondered why these killers don t save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill    after the fine first scene   the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you thought it was the killer but was just  someone else scares    these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music    i guess sudden   sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days    the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast    the slasher appears   attacks   the victim is eviscerated   and the tedious cycle appears anew    false scares should always be used in moderation    someone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren t as scary as they used to be    this movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit  it s not frightening    remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in  scream  and  scream 2     this movie still adheres to them    tons of illogical moments about   more than i really have the inclination to list    and i don t mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense    that type of illogical can be fun    this film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember    the last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you ll be laughing more than you ll be screaming    actually   you won t be screaming at all    at its best   the acting can barely be called   adequate   and the script could ve definitely used a rewrite or two    the film still manages to have some strong points    the killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans    there are some intentionally funny moments       these were exceeded by the unintentional ones      the film is well made from a technical standpoint    besides the first part   there is also another good scene   a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station    if there had only been more sequences like this   that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music    urban legend  might ve been worth your money    
Neg, my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love    i love ralph fiennes    i love uma thurman    i love sean connery    hell   i m even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw    i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago   and i ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since    a few months into the summer   however   i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times   and that it had ended up in the mid august dumping ground    then   in this final week before its official release   i learned that it was not to be screened for critics    and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs    and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique    my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things    the film i saw today didn t even meet those expectations    this is a lousy   incoherent mess    i would slam it harder   if it weren t for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine   lovable actors    but sets are ultimately empty   and the performances are completely uninspired    that s the main problem with the avengers   for all it s hip hop flash and tidal waves   none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired    it s like a chore   a bland exercise in superhero film making    it also feels like its been cut to pieces   clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots    this is just plain depressing    the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show    frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i ve never watched an episode    i wasn t alive then    i don t even watch television now    i m very sorry that i don t have this perspective   but   judging from the reviews i ve already read   knowing the tv show just makes matters worse    i didn t know and love john steed and emma peel   and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles    i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film    based on what the film told me   i gather that steed   fiennes   is some kind of british super guy   somewhat like james bond     and that dr   peel   thurman   is just a really smart doctor   who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits    they are to work together   under mother s orders   mother is played by jolly jim broadbent   while his co conspirator   father   is played by the equally talented fiona shaw      it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather    his name is de wynter   connery      he is a crazy scottish guy    our heroes had better stop him   or else            the weather will keep getting colder until they   have to go to hell to warm up     one of the film s few funny lines      along the way there is subplot after subplot   hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere   feel perfunctory   and ultimately make no sense    for example   our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos    now   killer bugs don t really go with the weather controlling theme of the film    the purpose of the bugs   other than to annihilate our heroes   is never established    they re never even directly connected to de wynter   they re controlled by his crazy henchman   played by eddie izzard      the special effects aren t bad   but they re loud   obnoxious   and intrusive    like so many scenes in the film   it seems present only to keep your attention from waning    and i guarantee you   it will wane    i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn t do any good to think    the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn t tell us what happens    there are several scenes in the preview that didn t make the final cut    in addition   many of the sequences have irritating   grainy film quality   which makes it feel low budget   the last scene is particularly bad      the scenes that don t feature action should be electric   thanks to our wonderful cast    they aren t    the action scenes should be electric   because this is an action film    they aren t   either    and what about this wasted cast    oh   it makes me weep with disappointment    we re talking ralph fiennes here   one of the best actors working today   one of the best actors * ever *    i love the guy    i ve loved all his films   until this one    he seems like he wants to understand the film   but he s as lost as we are    and thurman   in all of her spectacular beauty and talent   can t manage to look at home here       i don t blame her completely   for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way   and it can t be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting      connery   however   seems the most out of it   totally lacking any kind of focus   or interest   for that matter    who is to blame    is it the screenwriter   don macpherson    perhaps   although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right    is it the actors    for god s sake   no    these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling    i blame director jeremiah chechik   who shouldn t have been given the task to begin with    his best film   benny & joon   is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be   but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor    add to that a lack of experience in big budget action   and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory    if the avengers has a saving grace   it s the set design    the sets   by stuart craig   are big   colorful   and often pleasing to look at    i like the final set piece   on de wynter s island   even if none of it makes a bit of sense    i admired the overhead view of the stairs   showing dr   peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere    i also enjoyed michael kamen s music score   particularly in the opening credits    but this stuff is routine    good sets and music are nice   but there s a lot more that needs to be here    inspiration   for instance   would have been really nice    maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story    or a sense of purpose    most of all   though   i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles    damn this movie for not giving them the chance    
Neg, if snake eyes were a dog   you d put it to sleep    if it was a couch   you d put it out on the sidewalk   where it would sit for a week    if it were your child   you d be reading military school catalogs    if it were a ship    no   it wouldn t be the titanic   that would imply glamor and tragedy    it would be the exxon valdez       personal side note   i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip    for whatever reason   my hotel s cable system wasn t showing the astros braves game   which featured a randy johnson greg maddux matchup    this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free    so the invective   deserved as it is   should be seen in that perspective      snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie   and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater    snake eyes is not a good mystery movie   but i had some questions   where s the manager   and how do i get a re admit pass    if i fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent a car   can i sue brian de palma    is it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage s oscar    will someone please   i m begging you   give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents    and how   exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does    the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer    if you ve seen the trailer without seeing the movie   consider yourself fortunate    the trailer is a work of sheer genius    it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie    the noteworthy steadicam work   the exuberance of cage s performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman   the essential elements of the marginal plot    the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross       is a best trailer category at the oscars that far fetched   after all      but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie    the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot   detective ricky santoro   cage   must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay per view boxing match    unfortunately   there are multiple problems afoot    the trailer gives away much   too much of the story    the shooter is killed instantly   so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy    the film s secret is ho hum at best   and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is    without an interesting plot   without interesting dialogue   and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story   snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level    as much as i hated this movie   i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit    de palma is maddeningly inconsistent    he can   on his day   create amazingly well done movies   the untouchables   carlito s way      on off days   he can be   well   just horrid   the bonfire of the vanities   raising cain      snake eyes falls into the horrid category   but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film school degree of difficulty value    the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor    there is a split screen chase scene that looks pretty good   and it s followed by a god s eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that s imaginitively done    this is what s called giving the devil his due    but the technical skill doesn t even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie    placing plot holes to one side for a moment   snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history   george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers     a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps   and perhaps the worst   most overly drawn out ending in years    snake eyes is a criminal act   an evil waste of time and talent    cage   sinise   and yes   even de palma deserve better    the audience deserves better    but no refund   no re admit pass   no free popcorn coupon   can ever restore to us the time we ve spent or wash the awful images from our mind    however   we are left with one consolation   that we were warned by the movie s title    because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps    
Neg, the last line   or near to that honor   is the great butler   alfred   the ubergod   michael gough   saying     i think we need a bigger bat cave     or something to that note    that s exactly what this film is   too big for its own good because it has too damn much    cut batgirl out    cut one of the villains    it s too much to handle in one dosage    it s so much that characters get left behind    poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way   shape or form    and elle deserves better    this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher    it s also the fourth worst in the series   and second worst from joel      the series has been declining since its stunning debut   followed by the almost as stunning sequel and then the anti climactic third one   first by joel      this one s not anti climactic   i knew it was gonna suck    it s up to joel to make it fun though       batman forever   was fun    this is a big bore of over produced action sequences and shallow characters    i mean   this one bit    i m gonna put all the plot in one paragraph   mr   freeze   ah nold     who s wife was dying of some disease   has become the new big villain these days    he s a huge ex scientist who fell into some weird liquid   hello    joker     and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body    batman   george   and robin   chris   fight him a bit but find they re growing apart    meanwhile   another villain shows up   poison ivy   uma !     who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist   john glover   who kills her when she finds out he s used her research to develop an uberman   bane   who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had    she emerges from her chemicals   don t ask  cause i can t tell ya   as a sexy woman   the real uma   who s poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people    she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo    meanwhile   alfred s dying of the same disease mr   freeze s wife has   but in an earlier state than she     and his niece   barbara   alicia     comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade   but soon   well   not really soon   it takes her 2 hours   becomes batgirl    meanwhile   in an unfinished subplot   bruce   batman s alter ego   if you forgot   has been dating the lovely julie madison   the even lovlier elle macpherson   who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing    end of her for all we know    mr   freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population   don t ask ! ! !      the trio must team together   as family   to beat them    there ya go    not the whole story but no big context clues    too much   right    right !  the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels    however   while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline   although not wonderfully     joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one    he gets some corny speeches   a couple clever lines and that s it    maybe some stunts    for all this   i can t even comment on george clooney as batman   i hardly saw the guy !  and when i did   he had horrible dialogue to say    i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode    george is in between them    he s not quintessential   he s not horrible   he s good    but i m sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they ll be critically murdered for this sorry effort   we ll get a good script and clooney will shine   if he still has the job      the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher    last time   we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey    this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain   the same guy     mr   freeze    we feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants    arnold isn t very good   too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points    when he watches old movies of his wife   he actually looks somber    wow    but uma makes the most of her seductive character   getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness    it s like she s almost parodying herself in   pulp fiction   at points    she s incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better    as for the lower bat people   chris is the same as he was in   batman forever     although i think his work in these is too hokey when he s best at quieter parts in   scent of a woman   or just plain cool parts in   fried green tomotoes      alicia   i love the girl but she s not particularly good in this film    she can hypotheitically act   we all saw that in   clueless     but her lines kinda sound weird    and it isn t the mushy mouth this time    but in all fairness   she has virtually no part    joel gets around to her occasionally and when she s on   she does stupid stuff       although  i know i m not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma        and poor elle    poor   poor elle    i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act   for those of us who saw   sirens        but she has no part ! ! !  it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product    there are no   couch   scenes   like my best friend noticed      now listen to me on this one   in every   batman   flick   there s a couch scene    in the original   it was with vicki    in   returns     it was a good make out scene with selena    and in the last one   it was a chat with nicole    this one   it s nothing    and batgirl does next to nothing in this film till the end when she s suddenly   part of the family      fortunately   we get a lot of alfred    he s the always reliable butler   in case you didn t know   who has been with bruce all his life    he s a god    he s a father figure    he s also dying    this got to me    i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe   not in his tux   and freaking dying just gets to me    we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time       but  this is never answered   as this film is too cluttered    but in defense   it does have some good parts   other than uma    for one   george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do    and there are some nice touches    when they show the asylum at one point   they show the patient s belongings in a room and we see the riddler s costume    i laughed    and during a biker scene   involving robin and batgirl   another subplot never handled past initiation period     we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad asses dressed as   droogs   from   a clockwork orange      i laughed at all these    the film falls apart around the five minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes       or  did it just feel like that    the film should serve as another in the long line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays    people are fed up with stupid films    that s why the word of mouth killed   the lost world !    that s why last year   indy films grossed more than ever    that s why this will have a strong box office initative from people who just want to see it   like me   but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it    that s why the next two big budget aciton pics are john woo s   face/off   and barry sonnenfeld s   men in black     both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on    i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste    i like some of his films     flatliners       a time to kill     but a lot of them suck    he s a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that s what makes him great    but his costuming for woody allen s   sleeper   was more interesting than this one   and his costuming was cool   look for the nazi number      i love the   batman   series    the first two rocked and i did like the last one    but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three    hopefully   this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time    and maybe they ll get smart and bring back catwoman    and michael keaton    but we can only hope    
Neg, writers   dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh   based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer    starring   jamie lee curtis   william baldwin   donald sutherland   joanna pacula   sherman augustus   marshall bell   cliff curtis   julio oscar mechoso  i suppose i m not extremely surprised that   virus   comes to us from a deciple of james cameron   john bruno     and if i strain real hard   i could even say that it s an obvious given   particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr   cameron s early works    in fact     virus   is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the   aliens   vein   a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally threatening entity is out to get them   a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies   and maybe even to the first pictures   albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future    no such thing will happen to bruno   whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi landmark feature   while bruno may have studied under cameron s wing for years and years   i m beginning to wonder at what capacity   and what exactly did he learn from him    in fact     virus   should at least be mediocre   the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron   a director who   if anything   just knows how to make a movie   and then make a film like   virus   is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z grade schlockfest of a film   albeit a z grade schlockfest with a respectable budget    the film seems to not only borrow it s plot from last year s similarly fated   deep rising     but also from a clunkish b movie from the  80s called   leviathan     an underwater thriller starring peter weller   richard crenna   hector elizando   and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part   alien     part john carpenter s twisted remake of   the thing         virus     again   has a similar   uh   selling point   a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water    they get on    they break up into pairs and investigate    and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy   has taken over all the machines on board   have meshed the machines with parts from corpses   and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary   ha ha      not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving   not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond ian opening   the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir     destroying any of the suspense in what could happen   but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters    of its motley crew   it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper   a masculine potential romantic interest   a drunken captain   a black technician   a tatooed aborigine   a manic russian survivor   and a couple other candidates for alien food   none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin   plain piece of writing paper    and it s not the traditional argument for films like these   where you may in fact want them all to be eaten   even   aliens   played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers   but this was more of a plus side for the film as a whole than the opposite     instead   as another cliche goes   you just don t give a damn    i almost don t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub par to horrific   the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is   and she is   just not really here   and the latter being   and it pains me to say this as he s a particular favorite of mine   donald sutherland   who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance of which he should be ashamed    like anthony hopkins for   legends of the fall     the line   scrooooooo  em   has been thus embroidered upon my membrance      or peter o toole in   caligula      great actor   horrific performance    it happens every now and then   and it only helps sutherland s career that no one   except for an elite few   even bothered to see this film    though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years   waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can   read   early january   when everyone s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar nominees     it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film   it s laden with complex machinery   boasts respectable production design   and it may even feature believable special effects       if   of course   i   or anyone else   could see them       virus   mostly takes place on a large   abandoned cruiser   and mostly at night until the dawn   and mostly without the use of lights   not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey   but more so because   as the hollywood cliche seems to go     if it s dark enough   then the special effects will be more believable      and if you don t believe me   go back and rent   godzilla     and tell me if there s even one shot where we see godzilla either a   in his entirety in one wide shot   or b   n the light so that we can at least see him   well   you don t really have to sit through it again   just take my word for it      but all of this doesn t matter since   virus   is basically just one loud   cluttered mess of a movie    the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i ve ever seen   my   um   favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship   during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves   rain   and any other ocean extremeties the film can cook up   then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned   well   i must say   thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn t figure it out when i saw it      imagine the first attack of the aliens in   aliens     shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity   and that s basically the whole of   virus     one horribly directed action scene after the other   capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members    and my god   it s a long damn sit    with no interesting characters   no dramatic urgency   no tension   not one good moment of action   and no mesmerizing visuals   it s a wonder that it even got made    we already know that big movie studios  mentality is shallow at best   and movies like   out of sight   and   saving private ryan   give you more faith in them   but movies like   virus   manage to drain a little more out of the pool    i almost wish that instead of making this movie   john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light    they read the script   they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack   and he is     and they still went ahead with the project   only to have bruno and company shit back in their face    even though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie   i d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr   bruno for making a movie that could be this bad    in fact   shouts of   egad   man   what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway      are not only justifiable   but encouraged

Neg, this is your definitive   hollywood   movie   extremely predictable   following the basic formula   a horrible ending     overzealous writing   meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting   therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space   and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise ass character   of which we ve seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly   wasn t used enough here     i m afraid the film would have been completely unbearable    in this film   ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend    while in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her    over money   how original      while in jail she works out   exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition    now she has learned about a law titled   double jeopardy   stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her   although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works      now her po   parole officer     and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims    skipping over to the acting   the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress   no offense   she has been good [simon birch] and even very good to great [kiss the girls] at times   in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better        but she s terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying   doesn t really add to the movie at all   just takes away    as i d said   jones was fine   although he did not have much to work with    he was much more of a supporting character    which is fine   and he handled it well   especially considering the material he had to work with    i feel this film had alot going for it    originality not being an issue    the acting was the only thing   as i said   keeping it alive    the plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better    the action scenes were well made   however sometimes out of place      i was just left unsatisfied in the long run    so basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over thought   the plot has certainly been done before   generally speaking     the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot   and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones   who if he had some more screentime   could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating   in my book   anyway    keep this in mind   if you re in the mood for a good action film    rent the fugitive    d+  
Neg, dead bang   an action thriller starring don johnson   lives up to its dumb title   or at least to half of it    although dead bang is definitely dead   it is anything but a bang   in fact   they should have called this one   dead bore      in the film   johnson plays        you guessed it        a cop    the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character   jerry beck   is a gritty los angeles homicide detective   a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on   miami vice      a la mel gibson in lethal weapon   beck is an emotional wreck   complete with violent outbursts   unscrupulous police methods   and a bleak outlook on life    beck s wife has just divorced him   and she is cutting him off from their children    she will not even allow him to wish them   merry christmas   by telephone    but beck s family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead bang    beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop    his investigation starts in l   a   and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma   where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp    virtually every aspect of dead bang is inept and ineffective    the plot is incoherent and full of holes    the movie depicts beck s investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions    the action sequences in dead bang are strictly third rate   and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense    i certainly expected more from long time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller   the manchurian candidate  as well as black sunday   seven days in may   and the french connection ii    in all fairness to frankenheimer   however   i should note that most of dead bang s shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction    dead bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy   but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting    according to the movie s production notes   dead bang is based on the real life experiences of still active detective jerry beck    you would never guess this from watching dead bang   however   since the film totally lacks credibility   it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable    most of the characters in dead bang are either atrociously acted   underdeveloped   superfluous   or all of the above    william forsythe   for example   is painfully bad as arthur kressler   a wholesome by the book fbi agent who s offended by beck s foul language and unorthodox methods    forsythe s lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable    dead bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid     wkrp in cincinnati   and   frank s place       but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role   he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains    the sole function of penelope ann miller s character is to give dead bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less    i guess the film s title refers to this love scene since it s definitely a dead bang    the only real virtue of dead bang   believe it or not   is don johnson   who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie s pitiful script    johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth   and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life    and i must admit that dead bang does have one or two amusing moments    the funniest scene has johnson throwing up all over a criminal as he interrogates him    but when barf is the highlight of a movie   you know the movie s in trouble    the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck   in which he can t keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen    but two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make    
Neg, it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of todays movies or novels   you must suspend disbelief     however   there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies    it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg   indiana   where the film is set     does not have a mcdonald s   a sears store   a statue of a man on a horse   nor even a dam close by    even if you can ignore these somewhat white lies   even though the dam is crucial to hard rains plot     there is still a bunch of things that just dont gel    firstly   morgan freeman   possibly the greatest actor alive   after such films as driving miss daisy   the shawshank redemption and se7en     was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement    he  should  have played the town sheriff   an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman    as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg   its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases    i say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them   and it seems a tad strange that an entire town   with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way   can vanish before the flood has actually started    but nether the less   armored guard couriers tom   christian slater   and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van    with a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads   it doesnt take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road    jim   morgan freeman   and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars    but of course tom is more than willing to save the day   so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town    the local sheriff   randy quaid   whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4   and a couple of police men investigate the situation   but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars    director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy turvy   and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite goodies versus baddies    there are numerous twists in its plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience    but by the time these interesting changes occur   its far too late in the film for them to have much affect    hard rains continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had   and although its cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par    not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman   we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected    such titles as broken arrow   slater and john travolta   and face/off   nicholas cage and john travolta   come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations    strangely enough   they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta    we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre   but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character    if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow   my answer would have been a definite no    i now know that he has no excuse   and  can  do better   if you dont believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store      although hard rain never really works from the start   i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen    the addition of an enticing sub plot would have given the film time to breathe   rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that cant handle anything else    despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account   if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film    no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors   but it doesnt really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8   50 is compare this to other films    
Neg,    some houses are born bad     goes the haunting s tag line   to which i must add     some movies   too      nothing short of hiring a new cast   a more literate screenwriter   and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson s meritorious novel    the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy   and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don t frighten so much as numb the audience into submission the film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout   boo      fragile nell   taylor     bisexual theo   zeta jones     and smiley luke   wilson   are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders   hosted by professor marrow   neeson      marrow s secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house s bleak history    he s not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew   nell especially   who has some ancestral connection to the manor s previous inhabitants    taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big budget lead    for starters   her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes   when we re introduced to the mansion and all its fun house trappings    her character is supposed to be depressed   having tended to an unloving mother for too many years   but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame   alternately grouchy   mopey   wiggy and pathetic   and i kept wondering why the other characters didn t just ditch this bitch    as for the obscenely photogenic zeta jones   she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her    unfortunately   she s saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer    theo s assessment of the house       i love it !  sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters      who on earth would say that in place of   citizen kane meets the munsters         furthermore   would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description      both actresses fare better than neeson   who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble   and for good reason     and his character is the most bland    as luke puts it   dr   marrow pulls the old   academic bait and switch   on his subjects   but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he s accused    later   he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell   it s amusing to hear neeson shout   nell   repeatedly   given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name      why was this nice   helpful   and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start    the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti    his sets are obsessively detailed   and even before the cgi kicks in   they seem alive   never quite still    i do have one beef with this aspect of the production   the real life mansion used in exterior shots   nottinghamshire s harlaxton manor   is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company   no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins   always finish up in locations that were established in act one   as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house    eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting   and despite a powerhouse box office debut   i doubt it will recoup its costs   including marketing   domestically    thank jan de bont for that   proving for the third time that speed was a fluke   in that it was actually enjoyable   de bont has served up another ride   sans thrill    his images   well lit though they are   have an unmistakable been there done that quality   in fact   whole sequences   not to mention the cloaked   airy ghoul who owns the climax   feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back   peter jackson s the frighteners    i don t mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist   i mean to suggest that he s a hack   having found no new ways to give us chills    
Neg, play it to the bone is a punch drunk mess of a movie    containing a good cast but awful acting   an interesting premise but terrible execution   ron shelton   white men can t jump   gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two    rocky no   1 is vince boudreau   woody harrelson   edtv     a bald   tattooed   newly converted christian   whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word        something that he has not yet successfully achieved    rocky no   2 is caesar dominguez   antonio banderas   the 13th warrior     best friend of vince who is currently dating vince s ex girlfriend   grace    both men are nearing the end of their   almost   careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity    when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated   the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement    our boys are tapped to fight each other   the winner of which is   promised   a shot at a future title fight    the film is divided into two sections    at first   we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes   in grace s   sassy grassy   green muscle car   travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day    along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by    once in vegas   the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar    both mr   harrelson and mr   banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past   not that we d know it from their work here    mr   harrelson is uncomfortably awkward   apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince    the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable    mr   banderas is uncharacteristically non charismatic as caesar    weak and ineffectual   there is little life in his screen performance    the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another    tom sizemore   saving private ryan     robert wagner   austin powers ii   the spy who shagged me     and richard masur   fire down below   are crooked promoters   lucy liu   payback   is a sex starved hitchhiker looking for a good time   and lolita davidovich   gods and monsters     is the shared girlfriend who can t make her mind up which boxer she prefers    because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them   the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins    but even then   because the outcome is so predictably obvious   the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other    writer/director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed   well choreographed   well edited   and well performed    if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film    as it is   the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable    the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film    the phrase     play it to the bone  is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you ve achieved your desired goal    that is a biblical principle       know ye not that they which run in a race run all   but one receiveth the prize    so run   that ye may obtain      1 corinthians 9   24 [kjv]  achieving anything worthy in life requires   playing it to the bone      we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives    this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives    as a movie   play it to the bone is hardly worth our time    but as a principle of life   the phrase   play it to the bone   are words to live by    
Neg, i have no real tangible proof of this   but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script   written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director   then it is actually possible to make a good movie    using their logic   all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget    this is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time   not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre      now   before i continue to ferociously attack what s wrong with this film   i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller    catherine zeta jones plays virginia baker   an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal   sean connery      if you ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before   i really don t have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details   the two team up for various jobs   stealing various things for various purposes    the problem we come to is that we ve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn t break any new ground in the big budget/hollywood/action genre    the result is that the entire production feels contrived    i m going to be completely honest here   pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run time was looking at catherine zeta jones    now while this may be a compliment for ms   zeta jones   it certainly isn t for either the writers or the director   who are not nearly as clever as they think they are    just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between   entrapment   and   blackmail      with an eighty million dollar budget   you d think that entrapment would at least feature edge of your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x    well   you d be wrong    the action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular    unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment   die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by   11 years    the reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture   you know exactly what s going to happen   despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists    many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta jones in extremely tight fitting clothing    one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask    nothing wrong with that   but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was   so why didn t she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room    i ll tell you why   because it s a great excuse to photograph zeta jones  posterior as it slides underneath those beams   and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing   the rehearsal      ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie   and though he has great screen presence   although so do connery and zeta jones   and the most interesting character in the film   not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss   a concept i invented just to describe this picture      one last complaint   entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building   or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot   he ll spontaneously disappear in ninja like fashion    i can picture amiel patting himself on the back   thinking to himself   it ll leave the audience wondering for days   how did he do that      we know jon   it s called editing    
Neg, when i originally saw the trailer for   analyze this   a few months ago   i must admit   i thought it looked kind of lame    and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago   i thought it looked outright bad    but then when   analyze this   finally opened a few days ago   an odd thing happened    it got great reviews    critics were proclaiming it   hilarious   and a   dead on parody of mob movies      well   with praise like that   i figured   it must be good and so i headed off to the theater    you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts    well   turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for       analyze this   is slow   unfunny   and badly acted    don t get me wrong   i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century   but he is just out of his league here    i think the problem is he didn t quite know how to approach this material    he plays his character   mob boss paull vitti   somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama    if he had played the character straight   along the lines of leslie nielson in the   naked gun   series   he probably would have been a lot more successful    as it is   though   he plays the character completely serious at some moments   and for laughs at others    this doesn t work    it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold   you always know it s him    and the movie is badly paced   too    it never takes off    it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum    i think the blame for this should be placed on the script    it s obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie   mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist   but once this is established   the movie doesn t really go anywhere    the formula of the film seems to be this   billy crystal says no to deniro   deniro forces him   and much wackiness ensues    this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie    i ve said it before and i ll say it again   the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not it s funny    if   analyze this   had been funny   the pacing and bad acting wouldn t have bothered me    i would have been too busy laughing to notice    but as it is   i only chuckled a few times    the only really funny scene is a dead on parody of   the godfather      sadly   though   i don t think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody   because i was the only one laughing    but my sense of humour   i have come to realize   is vastly different from the general population    i loathed   there s something about mary     yet loved   baseketball      now   if you want a movie that * i * think is funny   go out and see   office space      it s full of genuine laughs and won t leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes   as   analyze this   did

Neg, there was probably a good reason that the warner bros   studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened    and   after seeing this piece of toxic waste   i now know why    this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago    fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god s country   somewhere in eastern kentucky    it s beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate   kris kristopherson   who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role      it turns out that he s filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit    seagal plays jack taggert   an aikido versed   fighting machine   who is an agent with the epa    no       not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa    it s the environmental protection agency    i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers !  taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice    written by someone named jeb   i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships   banjo picking preachers   and dumb as nails rednecks    but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in    seagal s idea of a disguise is a long length $1000 leather jacket    but to get closer to the kinfolk   he will fix people s porches for free    that s another great epa asset   teaching agents how to fix porches    slow and plodding   this project is a total mess    the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige    here   his bravado basically turns into bullyness    townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued    fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever    and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes    the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony   gets behind the pulpit   and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment    but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping   kristopherson   meets up with seagal    kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away    seagal gallantly replies     i ll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth      i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background    this is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal s righteousness and narcissistic arrogance    seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace   that of the enviro thriller   on deadly ground      however   the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this    still   i believe in preserving mother earth   so save your $5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity    
Neg, tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers   all searching for deeper meaning    however   they won t find much meaning in the real blonde   and not enough real humor   either    joe   matthew modine   is a struggling actor   or he claims to be one   even though he has no credits under his belt    his girlfriend   mary   catherine keener   has no pretensions about her career   she s a makeup artist   working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair   marlo thomas   and supermodel of the month   sahara   bridgette wilson      sahara   who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid   has an on again   off again relationship with joe s best friend   bob   maxwell caulfield      however   bob has gotten his biggest break yet   a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly   daryl hannah     who may be that illusive woman he s always pursued   a real blonde    there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde   but not enough    the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background   such as sahara s perfume ads     depression   it s not just a state of mind      but to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel    and   unfortunately   the film s forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic    take for example the film s framing device of an old lady and her dog    the story serves absolutely no purpose   makes little sense   and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie    matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film   but they re stuck in the most boring plotlines    modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley   who appears as another struggling actor    keener s character has a stronger edge   but the insult self defense class   taught by denis leary   no less   she is stuck in makes little sense    the movie s running time is under two hours   but it seems like it is well over it    there s just not enough humor to speed things along   and not enough meaning to propel any drama    
Neg, the ads for   batman and robin   scream   the event of the summer is here   and that s the problem    the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it       batman and robin   is 126 minutes of lavish sets   flashy costumes and big   confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance    it s like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows   bright   busy and visually diverting   but not very much fun    it wasn t always this way    tim burton s   batman   was an epic story of obsession and duality   of darkness and revenge    the film   while far from perfect   was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel    batman was a creepy   brooding creature of the night    the joker   brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson   was at once charismatic and repellent    batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin   battling inner demons and one another over gotham city s breathtaking gothic skyline    those days of the dark knight are gone   replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck       batman and robin   has far more in common with the campy 60 s batman tv show than with tim burton s tale of darkness    the blame lies with director joel schumacher    a former window dresser   schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes    unfortunately   when it comes time to have those people walk and talk   he hasn t the faintest notion of what to do       batman and robin   is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it s often difficult to tell who s whacking who    while the characters flail at each other   one liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti    a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing   but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film       batman and robin   doesn t merely lose momentum   it stalls out completely on several occasions    it s rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one    ironically   the parts of   batman and robin   that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing   and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne    easily the best batman yet   clooney s expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn t even hint at    the film s most effective scene is a tender   quiet exchange between clooney and alfred   michael gough     bruce wayne s butler and surrogate father    as for the other heroes   chris o donnell s robin is enthusiastic   perky and horny as hell   while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl    in a movie filled to the brim with major characters   the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne s girlfriend is puzzling    i suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built in nipples   shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight    of course   the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that s where   batman and robin   really suffers    as mr   freeze   arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years   spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion    laboring under a ton of appliances   schwarzenegger looks as if he s having trouble even moving in his suit   let alone trying to act    uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy    she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character   it s apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain   s/he must be a cartoonish   bumbling nerd      once thurman transforms into the eco psychotic poison ivy   she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss    thurman fails to maintain the character s maniacal sense of style though   and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film    the biggest lesson to be learned from   batman and robin   is that more is not better    joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy   but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is    some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam    i don t think so    my prescription    fire joel schumacher   but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist s convention so he ll understand that there s no hard feelings      give alicia silverstone her walking papers   while keeping clooney   o donnell and michael gough    call jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman    then   ditch the campiness and   for the love of pete   lose the   event   mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time    
Neg,    gordy   is not a movie   it is a 90 minute long   sesame street   skit   and a very bad one at that    this movie is so stupid and dumb that it s depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light   and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie    i m sure children are the target audience of this movie   but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it    it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy   voiced by garms     whose family has been taken away to   up north     which we know means death    of course we can hear the animals talk to each other   and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible    actually   it s almost funny in a way    the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears   a little girl named jinnie sue macallister   young   who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him    jinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it    what is the point of this    maybe she is one of the producer s relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something    we then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce   roescher   who is sad because his divorced mother is dating    he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue   but he accidentally falls in a pool   probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a $200 suit on   nah   didn t see that one coming !      starts to drown   and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him    if this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hank s grandfather   the original ceo   dies and leaves his fortune to hank        and gordy !  of course there must be a villain   but even this villain   donadio as sipes   isn t that evil    he never raises his voice or becomes angry   and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story    it s hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film   or if the filmmaker s are just this untalented and stupid    at times   gordy   is tolerable to watch   thus earning it one star and not the dreaded   z       but it s just so unbelievably boring   cliche   dumb   unfunny   corny   and just plain bad it may scare children   it certainly disturbed me       4/21/96     1/29/97     6/13/97   [see also     babe   ]  
Neg, senseless   r   marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian   and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life    alas   moments are simply that   moments   which are not enough to lift this fantasy/comedy above its one joke premise    granted   that one joke is initially amusing    when wayans s darryl witherspoon   an economics major at stratford university   hits some dire financial straits   he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses    after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses   darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm    at this point   the film sounds more like senseful than senseless   but through some turns of the plot   darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once   essentially leaving him  yes  senseless    this sets up some showcase moments for wayans s gift for physical comedy   especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely   hilariously limp    but these gags   and the gag behind the entire movie   quickly grows stale    once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses   instead of exploring any new comic territory   director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness    wayans approaches each go round with gusto   but by this point he s simply treading water for the rest of the film s unfunny duration    senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn t strive to be anything more than a comic trifle    however   the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity    darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash strapped family   and this   serious   angle seems to come from an entirely different movie    unlike wayans s last starring vehicle   the surprisingly effective   and serious   the 6th man   the   emotional   content of senseless is forced and unconvincing    any attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles  darryl s romance with janice   tamara taylor     a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself   does not generate sparks of any kind    once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros   comes to an end   the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising big screen future ahead of him    but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless   his film career could go the way of his once promising older brother   damon   who is now set to make his comeback  on television    
Neg, a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent   but one with no edge to it    it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich   s and stock characters of this genre    though it s a well written and well acted fluff piece   it still does not have too much to say that is surprising    it s made for the gentle art house set   those who don t want something too disturbing to think about    it s about a critically successful writer husband   alec   pryce     who is so self absorbed that he s threatened by his department store floor walking model wife   kate   bouquet     who wants to be a writer    she meets his crass publisher   vanni corso   walken     another self absorbed man   and a predictable relationship occurs    the fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband s first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet    she now wants her own identity and her independence    the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff   and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie    the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium   and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax    it s set in london   and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper   vanni    she later meets him as her hubby s new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality   and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel    alec who is an obnoxious grouse   someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with   tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book published  which only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni    the publisher is proud that he s a mamma s boy who never married and is a self made man who has earned millions    he has recently acquired a failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it   as he proudly tells kate     if my father could sell pizzas in harlem   i could sell culture in europe      the only thing that couldn t be sold   is this stiff story and tired plot line    the mystery to me   is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy    she soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soon to become beleaguered vanni    when she writes a second novel   he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did    it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one   as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper    a business affair was loosely based on the real life literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly   in their celebrated 1950s love triangle    
Neg, if you re the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn   butter optional     then this is the movie for you !  indeed   this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip offs of other recent action movies   or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them    it s difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film    but at least we re warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase   giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show    what are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie    first   the movie gives us an introductory premise    huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor   and in this area   many ships have disappeared    oooh       scary !  secondly   a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery   but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score    third   the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo   treat williams      he operates a sophisticated military style pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy    finally   in the cargo hold   we see those that hired him    they are also mercenaries that have tough looking haircuts   talk with accents   and try to show how macho they are    during their trip across the stormy sea   their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs    spotting a cruise ship in the distance   they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop   take the parts that they need   and then continue on their merry way    little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster    yet   they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds    this is nothing more than a by the book action film    their realization of the situation that they re in doesn t happen until they are in the bowels of the boat    those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed    the corridors on the ship are narrow   misty   and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare fests must have    yet   despite the predictable nature of this film   there are some scary   boo   moments    but most of it is just outright silly    and this film is unusually gory too    monsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains    there is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive    he screams horribly as the monster s digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away    additionally   it borrows heavily from speed2   alien and a bunch of other recent films    the mercenaries even run into a lone   surviving passenger   femke jannsen   who looks amazingly like sandra bullock    to be honest   when i left the theatre   i just had to laugh at how witless the film was    it s moronic fun at best    so   if you re hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of silliness   then this might just hit the spot

Neg, deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie    this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises   and   being true to its title   being deceptive    but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit    braxton   chris penn   and kennesaw   michael rooker   are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute   renee zellweger      their lone suspect is wayland   tim roth     a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker s pocket    however   a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators   as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables    braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives    braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook   ellen burstyn     a local bookie    kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite   rosanna arquette     believing his wife to be unfaithful    the plot is twisty and complex   with lots of lengthy flashbacks   and plenty of surprises    however   there are times when it is needlessly complex   and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost    take a look at l   a   confidential   or the film s more likely inspiration   the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled    the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot    for example   the film tells a few substories   such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender   or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear     but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable    there s never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation    they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay    the characters   themselves   are rather pathetic and despicable    not one of them is an ounce sympathetic   and as a result   the labyrinthine plot is all for naught    what does it matter who is guilty of what and why    writer directors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers  masterwork blood simple   or the wachowski brothers  less worthy bound    but   while they have got the plot twists down cold   they need to work on characterization and dialogue    
Neg, this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney s live  action george of the jungle    tarzan and the lost city   the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough s legendary hero to the big screen   is one of the most inept and ill timed of any tarzan adventure so far    badly conceived and poorly executed   tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves    i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan   it s not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie    furthermore   it s even more curious that this film is rated pg   which   by definition   rules out any sex or explicit violence    and   while i m not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story   tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production    of course   no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city   since the film s troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line    imagine george of the jungle stripped of all   intentional   humor   and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like    with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences   the film barely registers a pulse    anyone in search of a relatively entertaining   family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book   which uses the same basic elements to much better effect    the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery   which   unfortunately   includes the two lead actors      the film doesn t attempt to re tell the origin story   the thinking is that it has been done often enough    instead   tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a   k   a   john clayton a   k   a   tarzan the ape man   casper van dien   several days before his marriage to lady jane porter   jane march      he is living happily in england   enjoying the benefits of being a land owning noble    meanwhile   in central africa   the dastardly nigel ravens   steven waddington     a self proclaimed scholar and explorer   believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar   which he calls the cradle of civilization    on the way there   he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things   like burning native villages   to earn the wrath of the locals    one shaman   determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal   sends a mystical message to tarzan for help    with lady jane following close behind   he returns to the jungle where he was born    its patently obvious that casper van dien   one of the pretty boy heroes of starship troopers   was not hired on the basis of his acting ability    with his plastic facial expressions   monotone voice   and complete inability to make convincing animal noises   his range rivals that of steven seagal    his pecs   however   are impressive   and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off    jane march   on the other hand   has to keep her shirt on   which may be a first for her    some six years ago   march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud s steamy the lover    since then   she made the career killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night   which exploited her every acting defiency    tarzan continues this trend    march may be attractive   but   at least judging by this performance   she can t act    meanwhile   steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy    instead   he turns out to be little more than a nuisance    the story line is pure formula   which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies    the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless    the romantic elements are all contrived   in fact   lady jane s presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance    the special effects are truly bottom of the barrel   including some laughably bad men in ape costumes   apparently   animatronics were too expensive for this production      and   of course   as with all jungle movies   there are the obligatory cute animals    over the years   the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material    the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller   but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part   including gordon scott   who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role      weismuller made 12 tarzan features   van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number    and   having seen tarzan and the lost city   i would argue that the movie going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12    
Neg,    desperate measures   is a generic title for a film that s beyond generic    it s also a depressing waste of talent   with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles   not to mention once cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not cool flicks    this thriller is more   before and after   than   reversal of fortune      the movie is a big disappointment   and yet it s somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it    the premise is both promising and intriguing    too bad the execution s all wrong   though   because the set up of   desperate measures   boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use    san francisco cop frank connor   garcia   is a single parent with a troubling dilemma    his son matt   joseph cross   is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission    even worse   the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe   michael keaton     currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society    connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery   he s at first reluctant   but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital    when he does make a run for it   connor offers close pursuit   but for different reasons than his superiors   including the crusty brian cox      they want to take mccabe down   while connor needs to keep him alive   or all hope is lost for his little boy    one misstep   desperate measures   makes is in its underdevelopment of matt s illness    what s needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works   there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country   and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow    take   for example   a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital    the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him   and what does connor do    he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight    connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of   and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son    whatever    to be fair   though   the lack of story background is the least of the movie s problems    first and foremost is how cheaply   desperate measures   trades the potential of it s opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour    once mccabe escapes   the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills    there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away    also   the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot inducing   lip smacking villain   the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter   natch   that it completely casts garcia s frank connor by the dullsville wayside     desperate measures   appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist   and the movie s head scratcher of a send off confirms this    there is some good to be found amongst this mess   particularly in the acting department    cast against type   michael keaton s understated menace is highly effective    although he s not given much believable to work with   andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord    joseph cross   as garicia s ailing son   is surprisingly unsentimental   and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos    this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending   but most is lost    it goes without saying that   desperate measures   needs an operation of its very own    
Neg, robin williams is a comedic genus    that is   he is one when he s in a film that allows him space to move       flubber   straps him in a straitjacket   covers him with duct tape   stuffs him in a coat closet and piles furniture against the door to make sure that he doesn t get out    in a re make of its own 1961   absent minded professor     disney offers us proof that more is definitely less    recycling old films     that darned cat       101 dalmatians     dressed up as new is the newest money machine from the home of the mouse that roared    professor phillip brainard   williams   is a terminally forgetful scientist teaching at a small college    his fiancee   sara jean reynolds   marcia gay harden     president of the college is none too happy with him because he s left her waiting at the altar due to his lack of short term    and long term    memory    she s giving him one more chance    he blows that chance when he invents   flubber     flying rubber   and is so excited by his discovery that sara jean is once again awaiting him in her white dress    his tardiness is helped along by his jealous flying robotic assistant who wants him all to herself    it s not all bad news    flubber is a green jello that can magnify and reflect energy that is applied to it    brainard realizes the commercial potential within the goo can save the school from bankruptcy and being taken over by the town s evil industrialist charles hoenicker   raymond barry      while he s busy with his new breakthrough   the slighted sweetheart is being wooed by his sleazy rival wilson croft   christopher mcdonald      there s a flying car   flubber enhanced basketball game and an assortment of broken lab equipment   none of which are the least bit interesting or funny    at one point   my son looked around the audience and asked   why are these people laughing      although williams turns in one of his least inspired roles   he is easily the most lively of the actors    everyone else comes across as half asleep    the re make is successful in that respect    it feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties    i remember the original as being charming   but my guess is that the memory from almost four decades ago has been artificially enhanced by the years    there have been some updates    fred macmurray s flying model t has been replaced by a t bird    his faithful dog charlie is now   weebo     the hovering robot    the biggest change is that   with sophisticated computer animation   we now can have films show off special effects without being at all entertaining    flubber is anthropomorphized into a being supposedly with personality    the gloop has little arms and legs and splits into tiny little gloopettes for a big dance number    this has nothing to do with the story    the only possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so that kids can badger their parents into taking them to mcdonalds for the toys    not that contributing little to the plot is a big problem    there are very few aspects of the film that move the story and those that do don t make sense    the discovery of flubber is going to save the college because brainard can sell his flying car to ford    anyone with half a brain would be able to see that his intelligent flying automaton is worth billions    it s unbelievable that his lover   well   probably not a lover    after all this is disney   starts dating croft after the aborted wedding    there s not one appealing component of this man    after the professor discovers that smearing a golf ball with the gunk causes it to bounce uncontrollably around his lab wreaking havoc   i cringed as he picked up a bowling ball    this guy is beyond forgetful   venturing into the certifiable    co writer john hughes used to direct light weight but thoughtful teen films    the care behind   pretty in pink   and   the breakfast club   all went out the window after his   home alone   franchise heated up the box offices    looking much like   home alone 3 1/2       flubber   even features a couple of vapid goons who get banged around and a cute little boy who screams a lot    in some ways   it s difficult to judge this film    i have a suspicion that i m not it s target audience    after all   i measure my age in two digits    
Neg, ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his   or her   sophistication    it s full of stops and starts and usually   the punch line is ruined    i felt the same way watching drowning mona    skip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy    there are some slightly successful attempts at humor   but they only serve as window dressing    there is a running gag about the town   verplanck   n   y     being a test town for the then new yugo    everyone drives a yugo   differentiating their cars with personalized license plates    even the police chief drives one    there is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets    there also is a running gag about one of the characters   jeff   missing a hand and how it occurred    it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends    it turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend    there are some sight gags that pop up as well   such as mona s tombstone   which reads   demoted     instead of devoted    still   the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond    the lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona   midler      each scene with her is the same   scream at someone   hit someone   then scream some more    there s no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness    anyone off the street could have played the role   such as it is    the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts    each one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization    there is a burly   female car mechanic   so of course   there is a forced lesbianism gag    mona s son   jeff   marcus thomas   is a simpleton   hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth    chief of police rash   devito   likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter    there s nothing more to him    elle   the chief s daughter   campbell     is bland personified   a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married    mona s husband phil   fichtner   jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch    bob   affleck     elle s betrothed   and business partner to jeff   is a mumbling   obvious dullard    there is no contrast to any of the characters    by having at least one character with some wit   or wits   to serve as counterpoint to the others   perhaps steinfeld s attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better    ostensibly a murder mystery   drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately   then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer   who could be anyone due to mona s loving manner with everyone on town    even that aspect of the film fails   throwing in a convenient   ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things    it s been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood    what makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it s ineptitude    
Neg, what are we going to do with jim carrey    viewers of television s   in living color   know this one man cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill    viewers also know that   in living color   is a skit show and that a little of jim carrey goes a long way    unfortunately   this fact was forgotten by the makers of the carrey comedy ace ventura   pet detective    three writers   including carrey   worked on the slapstick story   which sends a self styled   pet detective   on the trail of a stolen dolphin    the missing mammal belongs to the miami dolphins   who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl    for plot porpoises   this story works as well as any three stooges short    carrey gets to do his   official   schtick as he snoops around greater miami    he leers and sneers   craning his neck to funny effect    he even does his captain kirk impersonation    again    all of this is pretty harmless stuff up until the point that you realize that the writers have absolutely no intention of focusing on anyone * other * than carrey       suggested alternate title  jim carrey   will do anything for a laugh      export it to france and you may have a hit    as it stands   ace ventura isn t even good kid s stuff    the profanity count   alone   is too high    which is ironic   since children are   probably   carrey s best audience    the film doesn t even have the goofball charm of chris elliott s recent no brainer cabin boy    sure   carrey has his moments    but what can you say about a film whose high points include watching carrey slink around to the theme from   mission impossible      ace ventura has one glaring incongruity    amid the butt jokes and double takes   the script takes great pains to set up an elaborate and rather funny   crying game   gag    and   for * this * intended audience   that takes   ahem   cojones    
Neg, there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space   it s just that none of them happen to be actors    the stars i m referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie s   outer space     the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home    yes   in terms of acting   the star power is            well   more like a falling star    kinda pretty   short lived   and pretty much dead    lost in space   as if you really didn t know   is based on the 60 s sci fi television series of the same name    it s the year 2058   and earth s precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population    john robinson   william hurt   is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet    earth s entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission   but nobody   whether it be john s family or hired battle pilot don west   matt leblanc     seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years    john s family consists of his wife maureen   mimi rogers     his atypical teenage daughter penny   lacey chabert     his ingenious son will   jack johnson     and his beautiful scientist daughter judy   heather graham      despite everyone s reluctance   the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space    unknown to anyone but the audience   there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission    dr   smith   gary oldman   has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour   and dr   smith has re programmed a talking robot to   destroy robinson family   !  when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides   the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination   and now the premise of being lost in space is complete    as for the audience   you will likely be lost in boredom by this point   wondering if the plot   like the jupiter 2   will ever get off the ground    it s hard to tell who deserves the most blame   the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script    chabert is basically the only one to overdo it   sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium    if you   like me   were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens   you re wrong !  that s just her normal voice !  in yet another example of a   friend   faltering on the big screen   leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming   make sense       it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod    graham is a babe   thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film    hurt   the black hole of excitement   sucks up any energy that might have been left    if hurt were available in tablet form   he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill    johnson isn t dull   he s just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody s ass all the time    want an example of how cool this kid can be    how about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family    hey   don t laugh   the thing actually listened to the mr   rogers would be proud sentiment    but alas   if you thought a character couldn t be much worse   there was rogers as the epitome of generic   or   mother as she was known      why hire an actress    they could ve had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it    now that would ve had some pizzazz !  lost in space luckily doesn t suffer in every single category that it could have    the special effects are crisp   clear   and at least mildly captivating   unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman   who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse    unfortunately   oldman is locked away for most of the film   giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy    while the special effects are pleasing to the eye   they are nothing you couldn t find in most modern sci fi films    contact   for example   far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination    lost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art   with numerous contradictions   the time travel aspect was horribly flawed !     wooden and corny acting   worse dialogue   and an ending so disappointing   you d be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens    then again   with an ending like this film has   it s obvious a sequel is already being considered    what an awful note to end on   knowing there could be more of this in a year or two    the attempt to be family oriented is commendable   but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups    well   danger potential movie goers !  danger !  this movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity    
Neg, so   it s thirty years later   and oscar and felix are together again    that might have been an exciting notion if it wasn t for the fact that the   odd couple   of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies   1993 s   grumpy old men     1995 s   grumpier old men     and 1997 s   out to sea     i   e       grumpiest old men        so     the odd couple ii     i   e       the grumpiest old men of all   really     seems just another entry in a tired series    the plot is even similar to that of   grumpy old men   in that lemmon and matthau s mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children    oscar s son   jonathan silverman   and felix s daughter   lisa waltz   are getting married   and former roommates felix ungar   lemmon   and oscar madison   matthau   meet at the airport and decide to share a car            then hilarity ensues    well   a few chuckles ensue anyway    neil simon   the award winning playwright who created oscar and felix   provides the screenplay   which is a shock   because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end    unlike the original play/movie     odd couple ii   doesn t find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters    instead   it depends upon a series of humorous situations   oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff   are caught smuggling mexicans over the border   take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands   the women are played by christine baranski of   cybill   and jean smart of   designing women       and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert    the original 1968 movie   the odd couple   remains a classic comedy    it introduced the motif of roommate as spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since    it was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team   which debuted in 1966 s   the fortune cookie       and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies     the front page     1974   and   buddy buddy     1981     before going their separate ways    the reunion of lemmon and matthau in   grumpy old men   six years ago was delightful   and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie    but   out to sea   and   the odd couple ii   are just beating a grumpy old horse       you can add lemmon s   my fellow americans     i   e       grumpy old presidents     to that list   too      let s hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do    let s hope also that we see neil simon s name on movies that do it justice   this is his first since 1993 s   lost in yonkers        
Neg, except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy   that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through    bette midler and dennis farina play lilly and dan   actress and author   once married   now violently divorced   and back together one last time for their daughter molly s   paula marshall   wedding    lilly and dan hate each other passionately    so passionately that they have sex at the wedding and fall in love again    each ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years and runs off with the other    molly   married now only 24 hours   runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith   jamie denton   tries to console the abandoned spouses    in molly s search for her parents   she somehow falls in love with lilly s paparazzo joey   danny nucci      meanwhile   the newlywed keith ends up consoling dan s wife rowena   gail o grady   in bed    the audience i saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery was hilarious    i m no dan quayle   but i thought it was a bit creepy    the message seemed to be   ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and have fun fucking who you wish         family values   aside   there s something cruel about all this    perhaps this movie would have played well as a black comedy   but the movie is a romantic comedy    we are supposed to be rooting for these creeps    reiner and screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable    lilly s husband is a new age flake who rambles about   emotional valet parking     so we can write him off as irrelevant    dan s wife is vain   manipulative   and jealous so we can write her off as a bitch    molly s husband is a career conscious   self centered republican politician who thinks she s too fat   and just for good measure   he also fucked dan s wife     so we can write him off as a prick    everyone else falls in love    but still   that somehow doesn t justify the actions of the movie s main characters       he s a prick   or   she s a bitch   is no defense    the movie is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialog    often during heated arguments    and by above average performances by midler and farina   breaking out of his character actor mold      other than that   it s a standard romantic comedy with a very substandard gimmick    
Neg, maybe this mission should have been scrubbed  mission to mars  a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman  there s a world of difference between artists and technicians    the artist has a vision to create something new    he may not do it well   it might be sloppy   but it s something you ve never seen before    a good technician can make it look good   but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else   it s going to be just a xerox    obviously successful films need both skills    brian de palma is a masterful technician    he s spent his career copying others   most notably hitchcock    he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work   but only because he has learned it by rote    aside from rare flashes of originality   his films are often soul dead    in de palma s latest   he turns his attention to stanley kubrick    to tell the truth   i enjoyed portions of this movie   but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called   2001      i enjoyed it even more when it was titled   close encounters      nasa has set its sights for mars    when the first crew meets with disaster   a rescue mission is sent to the red planet    they don t do so well either   but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut gone rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe    and it s all so boring    there are so many scenes that just don t work   it s difficult to begin    when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside down martian tornado   which looks remarkably like a sandworm from   dune     destroying everything in its path   they just hang out watching    error    the most interesting character   and that s not saying much   is killed off    error    the alien is laughable    error    the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable    error    there s some nice eyecandy    the face on mars   which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head   looks cool    a three dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world    maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic    but there s so much more that feels as if we ve been there before    from   2001     there s the rotating space station   the blinding white room    >from   close encounters     they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens    the list goes on    the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues    even gary sinise and tim robbins can t muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing    no one seems to care about anything that happens    you won t either    the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr   pepper   with a 20 foot tall logo   saves the day    they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film    
Neg, mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival    as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival    it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time    in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry    toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart    the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it    something else is what he did    the film opens with a woman   played by laura harring   about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life    she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep    meanwhile young vivacious betty   naomi watts   arrives in hollywood from canada    she wants to build a career as an actress    betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow    she does not know who the woman is    she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is    they fix on a name rita for her   but are not sure if this right or not    meanwhile local director adam kesher   justin theroux   has problems of his own    he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else   cammie rhodes   melissa george      these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong    there is also a strange character called the cowboy   monty montgomery   adding to the confusion    in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits    a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun    lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film    he just chooses not to    as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason    there are no earthworms   but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches    the film is a little long for the subject matter    toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes   clearly not intended for the tv pilot    unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers    i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the  4 to +4 scale    mulholland drive spoiler warning    i have rated this film fairly low    you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film    david lynch is in large part a dark satirist    most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside    in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre    what he does with this film is   are you sure you want to read this      playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on    the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout    then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something    the audience expectation is that they will add up    but he has given clues that are self contradictory    lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories    in fact   the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation   i think lynch is merely playing a joke    there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties    mad magazine called it a poiuyt    other sources called it a tri  pronged u bar    look at small portions of it and makes sense    look at the whole figure and it does not    this film is   in my estimation   the cinematic equivalent of a tri pronged u bar    
Neg, ingredients   possessed plastic dolls in love   plastic dolls having sex  starring   jennifer tilly   voice of brad dourif   katherine heigl   nick stabile   john ritter  synopsis   this is the fourth film in the chucky series   which debuted in the late 1980s    basically   chucky is a plastic doll that can walk and talk because it is possessed by the spirit of a slain murderer    in bride of chucky   chucky s longtime girlfriend tiffany   jennifer tilly   dies and her spirit inhabits a female plastic doll through voodoo    dolls tiffany and chucky get married and embark on a quest to reach a cemetery in new jersey   where a mystical gem might enable them to be humans    the dolls stow away in the back of a vehicle driven by a newly eloped couple   so in the side plot   the couple suspects each other of being a murderer    opinion   bride of chucky is an attempt at horror with humor   but doesn t succeed    somehow   chucky moaning about mid life crisis   and how he should have gotten married does not make for a very scary chucky    and tiffany harping about mid life crisis   and how she should have gotten married does not make for a very scary tiffany    the suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tilly s cleavage to keep attention during the first half   and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second half    the best that can be said about bride of chucky is that it is sarcastic    
Neg, watching the movie   i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup   cute  n cuddly   computer generated monkey    if the monkey died   the movie got an extra half star    alas   the monkey showed up at the end   unharmed   to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs    what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars    that s pretty generous   considering the movie s camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek    when will robinson   jack johnson   teaches his pet robot about friendship   you are actually supposed to buy it    so why such a seemingly high rating    there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage    first   we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater    the sound and screen kicked ass    nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did   and i don t necessarily mean that in a good way      also   there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons   or getting caught up in the movie s tension    i even liked the computer generated settings    i usually prefer to see models or sets   but the cg was more detailed than i ve seen in a lot of movies   it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities    also   gary oldman is never a bad actor   even though he is typecast as a villain    william hurt isn t too bad either    neither actor had a great role   but their performances were watchable    and perhaps i shouldn t admit this   but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood    there is very little swearing or blood   there is a strong moral message   saccharine though it is   there is a bit of romance   whose culmination after 2 hours is a   real   kiss    no sex      it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six    those movies were probably as bad as lost in space   but at the time   they were manna from heaven    that type of moviemaking is a lost art    now for the bad news    worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue    it s squeaky clean   family fun   trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction       you better hold on to your joystick     is one such line    and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs   they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign    second worst   and closely related   is the screenplay    the story s exposition takes place at a press conference   which allows the writers to explain what s happening with the least amount of creativity   effort   or interest    once the story gets going   i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while   but on the whole   the situations that arise are silly and contrived    when gary oldman easily reprograms will s pet robot to kill the robinsons   my friend summed it up perfectly     he flipped the switch to  evil        then there s the tone of the movie    the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson    then it could be an adventure movie    they re mostly right   except that johnson   will   wasn t a good enough actor to carry it off    still   that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination    just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn t mean that we have to bow to a   promise keepers   notion of who s the center of a family    many quality family films have been made with a non traditional family structure   fly away home comes to mind   to much better effect    and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie    in star wars   the rebels were the good guys    we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system    in lost in space   the rebels are the bad guys   a terrorist force that must be killed   crushed and silenced so that our children may live free    that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists    finally   a few specific details deserve criticism    the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056    why    why bother saying what year this is    just tell us it s the future    i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997    setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won t be timeless   not that this movie was really in the running anyway        then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole    this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny s barber chair   and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven t learned a thing about ergonomics    one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed   it made lost in space look cool    the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and   out of context   made it sound hip    this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie    but if that s the best part of the movie   i can t in good conscience recommend it    still   if you get stuck seeing it   as we did   you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance   think of liking bad movies as a child   and bring along your   bad movie bingo   cards    
Neg, i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night   but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies    luckily   my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta !  i knew it was going to be a bad print with only half faces and poor sound quality   but i couldn t help myself        i got it    well   after watching it   it indeed was a bad print   i was glad i didn t dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie    this movie really sucks    it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy ! !  for example   how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days    jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail    the songs are bad   the acting is bad   especially deepti bhatnagar s     and the direction is the worst of all    the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up    i didn t even finish the movie        i couldn t take it anymore    note   but if anyone out there liked aatish   by the same director     i guess you d like this movie    it s practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff    aditya panscholi is the sidekick again       i was going to give it a zero   but i personally like jackie shroff   so i loosened up a little    he looked fresh   wore good clothes   as always     and his performance   even though it wasn t his best   was the only saving grace of the movie    
Neg, starship troopers is a bad movie    i mean   a really   really   bad movie    not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood   gore and body parts shown on the screen   it blissfully jumps over that line   apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds   of which i saw many in the theatre      looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence   we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best   no strong lead characters   a blatant disregard for physics   and a very obvious naziesque theme    that being said   onto the review   the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation   who s logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle     urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs   who are attempting to destroy earth    the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance   pledging allegiance to the federation   again   sound familiar        as the movie progresses   we are shown terror tactic training   as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm   and throws a knife through another s hand    eventually   the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy   to fight the bugs on their home planet    as our faster than light travelling   heroes   arrive on planet   they drop onto the planet   and burst our of their craft brandishing           what      you say     laser beam weapons    sonic weapons    phasers    photon cannons        nope   they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns   pump action rifles   and tactical nuclear weapons !  i guess a lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry    as the assault begins   our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon    two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them   and one even sees a streak fly by   but disregards it as nothing    this of course   leads to more massive carnage   blood shed   and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies    again   i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons !  in the end   we see neil patrick   doogie howser   harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat   hat   and gloves    he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug   and then proclaims that the bugs are scared !  this sets the troopers into a frenzy   as they are now one step closer to completing their goal   total genocide of a species   again   sound familiar          i have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review   but given it s non existence   i may have anyway    i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart   but don t want to bore you too badly    in short   i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pro nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies   a drivers education accident scene film   and a complete blank screen   the plot   of course      i wouldn t recommend this movie to anyone   anywhere   under any circumstance    copyright   c   1997 tim jandt   >  
Neg, capsule   one of the ten worst movies ever made    christopher lambert vs   evil ninjas in modern day japan        and nobody wins    the hunted is such a bad movie   so completely inept and so totally brain damaged that i could almost feel affection for it    i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it   if it weren t also insanely xenophobic and insulting    christopher lambert plays a computer parts salesman who s on business in japan    he meets a slinky young woman   joan chen   and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her    and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader   john lone      apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered    since lambert is a witness   he s of course the next one to die    let s stop and think about this for a second    if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society   he d have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock    in this movie   the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him    i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body    you know what a goof field is   that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is    this is   of course   only the beginning of the movie s problems    lambert eventually finds pseudo safety with a long haired modern day samurai   yoshio harada   and his partner    yoko shimada   who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun    they are the two best things in the movie   in every scene they have authority and presence   and they actually look like they belong here   even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows    the script doesn t know what the hell to do with them    lone   as the bad guy   is zero dimensional    the only bad guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him    in the hunted   this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype    what s funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes    there s a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver   and a girl in a pachinko parlor    but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful    also   the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack    get the cd    that manages to survive despite the drek it s been designed to accompany    there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing    a gory   excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment   and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re couple the whole thing with the movie s relentlessly stupid plot    by the time we get to the final showdown   with lambert getting to wield his own sword   which   judging from the ham handed editing of one scene   was forged in seven hours or so     we no longer care    we re not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies !  someone once said that the key to good art    good movies   good books   whatever    is to start somewhere interesting   end up somewhere interesting   and show respect for the audience all along the way    this movie bungles two out of three   badly

Neg, deserves recognition for   achieving the near impossible task of making a grander monument to self love than steven seagal s on deadly ground    capsule review   a question   after the floating baby ruth that was waterworld   what in the @$&% were the hollywood execs who gave kevin costner the money to make another post apocalyptic movie thinking    in this 3 hour advertisement for his new hair weave   costner plays a nameless drifter who dons a long dead postal employee s uniform and gradually turns a nuked out usa into an idealized hippy dippy society       judging by the costuming at the end of the movie   the main accomplishment of this brave new world is in re inventing polyester      when he s not pointing the camera directly at himself   director costner does have a nice visual sense   and it is undeniably fascinating to see such an unabashedly jingoistic film in the trust no one 90 s   but by the time the second hour rolled around   i was reduced to sitting on my hands to keep from clawing out my own eyes    mark this one   return to sender      
Neg, starring ben stiller   elizabeth hurley   maria bello   janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz   based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz  permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie   though it took me a few days to conclude this    the film is more masturbatory than bleak   with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity       he has a $6000 a week drug habit      ultimately   as adapted by veloz   jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve   you are less mystified by his self destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself    ben stiller plays stahl   a young author who arrives in l   a   with ambition and a nasty drug habit    he eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr   chompers   a thinly veiled stand in for   alf     chompers looks just like alf except he s blue     marries a producer   hurley   so she can get a green card   and hooks up with a spanish mother   liz torres     who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons    insert proverbial downward spiral here    permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback   with recovering addict bello meeting stiller   at a fastfood restaurant   where stiller works the drive thru as part of rehab     taking him back to a hotel   and between bouts of serious screwing   listening to his life story    i ve spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive worse   i ve been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive    as stahl   stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect   post there s something about mary   of either the actor or a comedy writer    what separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk junkies   it seems   is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy    watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby !  watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack fueled babble !  stiller gives a technically flawless performance   the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie    but permanent midnight is mostly soulless    when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved    and then answers it in the form of bello s character   basically a shrink in black panties     could a person care less    in the film version of his autobiography of the same name   stahl doesn t need saving   he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself    if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie   it s that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood types known to man       stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs    is this hollywood       california      i learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead    of course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems    so   basically   his drug habit got him a book deal   a movie based on his life   and now he s apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects    so much for the moral of that story    temporary midnight is more like it     bill chambers   september   1998  
Neg, the camera zooms in incredibly close    it focuses on the closed eyes of a person presumed dead    all of a sudden   with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse   his eyelids open    the camera zooms in incredibly close    it focuses on one of the characters desperately running for her life    then   with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse   she bumps into the killer    the camera zooms in incredibly close    it focuses on a door from where seemingly strange sounds emanate    all of a sudden   with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse   the doors swing open to reveal what s inside    close up thrill shots such as these seemed to elicit more laughter from the audience rather than genuine fear   which is a pretty good sign that you re not watching the thriller that the director had originally envisioned    rather   you adopt the opinion that the characters are so goofy and so unaware of the trouble that they re in   that you stop caring about who lives   who dies and where the story goes    instead   you become more interested in how the characters get killed off    the four young teenagers who are the potential sacrificial lambs for this movie are helen and barry and julie and ray   two couples and dear friends to one another    during the summer just after high school graduation   they take a fateful drive down a dark mountain highway    suddenly   without warning   their car hits someone whom the teens presume was killed as a result of that collision    fearing jail time and possible manslaughter charges if they confess   they instead decide to dump the body into the ocean and make a pact never to discuss the episode again    a year goes by and things among the four friends begin to change    relationships fizzle   future dreams crumble   and attitudes change    but   they can not forget what they did    and apparently   neither can someone else    someone begins to send letters to all four of the teens with the frightening message     i know what you did last summer      the letter writer   a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a large metal hook   soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt down the four teens    it s now up to the four of them to try to figure out who the killer is before it s too late    while this movie has some nice visually eerie effects   too much of it s impact had to be generated with extreme close ups   while the level of suspense was choppy at best    there is so much more that this movie could have been   but decided to give us nothing but cheap thrills    it could have been a clever whodunit   but discovering who ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders    it could have explored the changed friendships after a year of adulthood   but seemed to only include that aspect to add 15 more minutes to the film    it could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime you re alone and you see shadowy figures moving about   you don t walk towards them yelling   hello      once you yell   hello     you can expect an extreme close up   a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse    it s difficult to be in suspense when you know what s about to happen    the only redeeming aspect of the movie is that i now have a neat idea for a halloween costume   but i m not sure if the local costume store sells rubber slickers and hooks    the horror that i experienced from this film is realizing that i actually went to see it    
Neg,    goodbye   lover   sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may   and one look will tell you why    it s a mess    and that s * way * before ellen degeneres shows up    the film is one of those torrid double indemnity crime stories that   in this case   required the services of three screenwriters    i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller   one wrote a murder mystery   and one wrote a comedy   then director roland joff   tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment    i didn t laugh at ellen degeneres much   i think i was supposed to      degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse   a tough talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair    either degeneres is wearing a wig  as most of the actors appear to be  or she doesn t yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist    every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip   but her incessant wisecracking is poorly written and merely stupid    her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is   at least she died healthy      and that s one of her wittier asides    degeneres  sgt    rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of       wait    to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple crosses    it s best described this way    sultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore   patricia arquette   is married to jake   a   creative yet unfocused     and alcoholic   advertising rep   played by dermot mulroney    sandra likes to act out her deep seated sexual fantasies and jake s brother ben   the suave as ever don johnson   likes to help    ben is also coming on to his petite   mousy co worker peggy blaine   mary louise parker   and someone   somewhere   is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his    the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again    although there are some genuine surprises   the plot twists get too contrived too quickly    probably around the time degeneres  gumcracking gumshoe appears    at least the former   ellen   star is going for something a little different    arquette turns in yet another of her stiletto heeled   platinum blonde bombshell roles   see     lost highway       true romance     while quoting embarrassing lines like   i m not wearing any underwear      i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this    here s an example of some of the film s flat out stupidity    sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film s duplicitous lovers    she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite   the sound of music   on her car stereo   intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims    so what was the point of the wig and the car       the sound of music   stuff might be a reference to   the wizard of oz   allusions in david lynch s   wild at heart     but if so joff   must have forgotten that   wild at heart   was a despicable movie    it s hard to believe that   goodbye   lover   was directed by the same person who made   the killing fields   and   the mission      it s not   however   hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long    it should have stayed there    
Neg, as with any gen x mtv movie   like last year s dead man on campus     the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points   sex and football    those two items   wrapped in a guilty pleasure package   are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially   but sales will decline for two reasons    first   the football sequences are nothing new   nor can they be   the sports genre isn t mainstream and it s been retread to death    second   the sex is just bad    despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all night strip club party   there s nothing even remotely tantalizing    the acting is mostly mediocre   not including the fantastic jon voight    cultivating his usual sliminess   voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer    kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes  twenty two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years   this year he plans to make it twenty three    unfortunately   when his star quarterback   lance harbor   paul walker     goes down for the count   he s got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon   james van der beek      moxon leads the team through its last four games   and then must cope with his newfound stardom   the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie   amy smart     and other temptations that abound in football crazy west canaan    most regions of the country are not nearly as football crazy as texas   and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most    similarly   the set design is wrong for a high school setting   the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms   radio headsets   which never seem to work   however   and instead require coaches to signal plays manually     and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer    these elements   as well as the heavy drinking and carousing   might be more appropriate on a college campus    but mtv s core audience is the high school demographic    this focus is further emphasized by the casting   james van der beek   of tv s   dawson s creek     is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero   although he never manages to do anything with the role    other stars are similarly young and unmemorable    there s not much that goes right about varsity blues   and there s not much to like about it   either    everything herein has already been done   and if it hasn t   the movie manages to botch it one way or another    this is certainly missable    
Neg, nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink and a concussive nudge bombast o rama con air    the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe   a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill fated bar room brawl    the prison scenes are accompanied by voice overs in which poe   in a languid southern drawl   describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met    if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity   it probably should    cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim witted and ridiculous   and that he s going to have to do something to keep himself entertained    and thus he slips into a familiar   surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings    cage plays cameron poe as a buffed up version of raising arizona s h   i   mcdonnough    cage should have known what he was getting himself into    he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock   and if there s one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production   even without his late partner don simpson     it s that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the  last  bruckheimer production    the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage s performance    in the rock   cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time    that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self awareness    while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home   cage s goal is different but just as simple   to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact    audiences   too   should know what they re getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production    in fact   the marketing people are counting on it    no one who loathed the rock for its swear grunt blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air   no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded    director simon west   yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab s soda fountain   delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture   it s perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma   like insulin   con air does the work of a gland      what he doesn t deliver is a moment of suspense    a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock s notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk   a really    really  big desk and a really    really  big bomb will serve the purpose nicely    if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension   they might have done something with con air s creepiest set up    at a desert stop for the plane load of convicts   serial killer garland greene   steve buscemi   wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool    their tete a tete is eerie and menacing   providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains   danny trejo   ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them      in fact   con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement    too many characters   too much editing   too many dopey punch lines   too much of the cheap   ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts    it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance    while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack   as a u   s   marshal   goes for earnest   cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep    his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape   his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies    it doesn t bode well for cage s appearance in face/off later this month   perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over    there s a word for people like you   nicolas    that word is called recidivist       repeat  offender

Neg, it s always a bad sign when the core audience of a film    children    are either walking out early or are half asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film    that about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians   a cold pea soup of cute animals   stupid home alone antics   a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans   and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression    indeed   walt disney is rolling over in his grave again   cursing john hughes  name for making the original live action 101 dalmatians   one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time   and now its sequel    the main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor   101 dalmatians    the original made more than $100 million dollars at the box office   spawned a torrid collection of   collectible   items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal marts across the country   and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas    well   it s been about four years since then   and dalmatian fever is coming back   and this time it s digitally enhanced    here s the story    cruella de vil   glenn close   is released from prison due to the   cure   of her puppy homicide urges by one dr   pavlov       oh   how witty      she rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer   who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film    cruella then becomes ella    dog lover    until the plot twists   like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck   and she becomes the evil vixen again    a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat   but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula    at this point   i was envying those kids filing out of the theater    how low have glenn close and gerard depardieu   as the film s villain   sunk in the film business    it s almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon    and depardieu        how can a french guy have a bad french accent    and never mind the toilet brush haircut    the only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent   courtesy of eric idle   that thinks he s a rottweiler    now that s funny    
Neg,    the animal   is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along   generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling    it s clunky and slow   like watching an 18 wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill    there are certainly better things you can do with your time    actually   if you ve seen the trailer   then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments    the story centers on bland marvin   rob schneider     who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer    but he s afflicted with loser itis    dogs attack him   neighbors torment him   children bully him   and his co workers ignore him    truthfully   with his bad haircut   seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic   little richard   and giant poodles   and his unenthusiastic demeanor   we d probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun    this is actually bad because you can t like a character if you can t develop sympathy for him    we never do   and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor    however   marvin is found by an eccentric doctor   michael caton   who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him   implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs    as a result   marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed    he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body   swim with the speed of a dolphin   and can run as fast as a cheetah    imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation    with his enhanced abilities   he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him    however   the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn   and instead   marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic   sexual urges    goats beware !  he also chases cats   urinates to mark his territory   or growls at his enemies    what he should ve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich    equally tenuous is its other running joke   which involves one of his friends   guy torry   who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he s black       it s reverse racism     he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything    this element doesn t work the first time it s mentioned   and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence    you don t have to be as wise as an owl to realize that   the animal   is tame    if there s any reason to see this film   it s to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut    remember her    she was voted off in week 11 of the 13 week program     survivor      here   she plays marvin s sunny love interest    while her role required very little actual acting   she seemed very comfortable   even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog       yuck !      with her adorable disposition   radiant smile   and playful innocence   she could be a meg ryan in the making    it s too bad that she s in such a mediocre offering  
Neg, romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant    with director peter medak   whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays   and top notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin   they seemed likely to be a successful combination    those mentioned films   however   brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not   a solid   well written screenplay    call me cynical   but the jobs of writer and producer don t seem to mix well    gary oldman plays jack grimaldi   a good cop turned bad   selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife    his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname   although the name doesn t provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character    jack has become addicted to   feeding the hole     a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money    when he realizes his colleagues are being shot   he feebly attempts to get out    gary oldman s performance is disappointingly weak   he seems nearly bored    in the process   he also gets tangled up with mona demarkov   a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone   played adequately by roy scheider    demarkov   played by lena olin   is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world    this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2   i can t remember seeing a character quite like her    after being shot   handcuffed   and thrown in the back seat of a car   she still manages to cause an accident   kick out the windshield with her legs   grab a suitcase full of money   plus some important documentation     climb through the rubble   land on her shot leg   and still succeed at running for safety    what a woman !  lena olin s performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film    anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo s wife    there is little insight into her character    she s depressed   she makes obvious references   she mopes around the house    juliette lewis   as romeo s girlfriend   is treated with the same cliche attitudes   although ms   lewis  portrayal certainly didn t improve it    both women were anything but sexy or attractive    poorly developed characters aside   the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems    it is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character   not   to do something    for example   jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope out the mob scene    fine    jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite    fine    what does jack proceed to do    he brushes his friends off by telling them he isn t feeling well   then strolls over to the boss    why    the boss had all ready threatened him   falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack s toes by the gravesite    i guess they weren t worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral          or here s another   demarkov set up her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw    she proceeded to set the place on fire    wouldn t the flames burn off the fingerprints    aren t dental records more important    as bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be   couldn t she come up with a better plot       and it took her no time at all to get a good fitting   functional prosthesis      lack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film    this film doesn t even add up the large details    there is little or no consistency in the story line    not much makes sense    the direction lacks cohesion   surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable    the moods shift   the styles shift   and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one    so while it certainly isn t reservoir dogs   it certainly isn t diva    there s plenty more to tear apart in this film    my advice to someone who hasn t seen it to to wait until it comes on video    there are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously    it s not a boring film   just not a good one    or an intelligent one    
Neg, 54 is dull   perfunctory   uninspired   and boring    a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives   flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors    i   however   would rather cut to the chase    54 is dull   perfunctory   uninspired   and boring    there is nothing in it    not a glimpse of depth   nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight    there is no electricity in any of the scenes   or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots    and it s underdeveloped   and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they re in this year s boogie nights    they are so wrong    the picture has been assembled by mark christopher    based on this film   i don t know how he got a job in the business    54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name   which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s    i don t know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released   but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson s brilliant work in every possible way   from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography    what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great   depth   intelligence   energy   fascinating characters   and challenging themes    54 can t even measure up to the last days of disco   which is flawed   but still smart and entertaining    it s remarkably bad timing   i d say   to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind    i have exaggerated   though   there is one interesting character   and one terrific performance    that character is steve rubell   played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves    steve rubell is the owner of studio 54   and if christopher had focused on him   then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself    alas   we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane   ryan phillippe     a going nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club   thanks to rubell s homosexual impulses    it s here that he meets his friends   the array of uninteresting characters   his co worker   greg   brecklin meyer     his wife   anita   salma hayek     and   of course   the love interest   julie black   neve campbell      shane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning   and he has a reasonably sturdy home life       some of the scenes with his father border on interesting   while heather matarazzo   who plays his sister   pushes phillippe off the screen      but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene   and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs    why his   friends   push him into drugs is never really explained   but the fact that they are   friends   is questioned only is superficial ways   greg gets really mad at shane because he s been elevated to bartender status      there isn t a single conflict that takes center stage   except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works    most of the film is dumb   and most of the dialogue is inane    there s a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black   and   in the next scene   they re arm in arm without a bit of development    then   they re kissing in a bowling alley !  this is five minutes of material   thrown into the picture at the last minute   well past the one hour mark   and this isn t a long film to begin with      campbell is a talented actress   but she needs a role that gives her a little depth    this one doesn t    and phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever   this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg s star making role in boogie nights    he seems dumb and misguided   and his voice never changes tone    i guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body   but he seems pretty lanky to me    he s all wrong for a lead role   but it doesn t help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters    by the end of 54   shane s most notable trait is his stupid   fake accent    the rest of the performances are wasted    hayek is an energetic   talented young actress   and does almost nothing here    meyer is endearing   but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard    only myers   by sheer force of talent   manages to rise above christopher s wading pool of a script    rubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters   but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance    in fact   myers is the sole reason to see 54   and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him    i ve read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail    frankly   i don t care    it s easy to recreate something technical like this    a fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task    besides   christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible   anyway    aside from myers  performance   54 is a complete failure    it s dull   perfunctory   uninspired   and boring    some may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair   but they re so obvious to me    in any event   54 is pallid without the contrast    it doesn t even work as mindless entertainment   it s so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it    so   don t forget those key words   dull   perfunctory   uninspired   and boring    everything else i said was just padding    
Neg, an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer    you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage   which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it s hollywood existence    when i think of the screenwriters behind this film   i picture a room full of monkeys    the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves    all of the monkeys combine their efforts   hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark s office    the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clark s desk while flailing his arms and shrieking    the director appears to be deep in thought   until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims `i love it ! ! !    the writing behind this project is embarrassing    for your amusement   i will explain the plot    dr   kinder   kathleen turner   and dr   heep   christopher lloyd   are two of the cold hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute   where peculiar studies are going on    as the story goes   there is an ancient myth explaining that babies   ages 2 and under   know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences    when they move past this phase   they become like any other drooling toddler    kinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies   namely little sylvester   sly for short     who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission   impossible team    there is so much crap derived from this premise   despite the fact it s virtually identical to the plot in look who s talking !     a far superior film in any league      you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene    sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung fu tactics    question   it s obvious the babies are super smart   but why are they able to fight like jackie chan      the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers    it s a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes  familiar home alone formula    i also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90 s knowledge   quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors    the effects in baby geniuses   similar to the talking animals in babe   are pathetic   the editing is a disaster   and the jokes are never funny    the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are `cute     i suppose they are    i can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute    other instances   though   i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script    there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever   their entire existence is based on punch lines    peter macnicol and kim cattrall   as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester s twin   are both miscast    then again   i don t suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid    meanwhile   dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench   hahaha      i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs    instead of watching this   i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling    or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark infested waters    anything to avoid this painful movie    the final line in the film   spoken by the bratty sylvester   is `if they think i m doing the sequel for less than $20 mill   they re nuts     sequel    please have mercy    
Neg,    houston   we have a serious problem      after making   mission   impossible     brian de palma has a lot to live up to    by making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew   he hopes to reach the modern audience    and the possibilities are certainly there   but the result is a great disaster    starting in a near future   with a prologue copied from   apollo 13     de palma slowly builds up his   story      the human race has already set foot on mars    a research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened    this is basically the whole plot    so it s hard to imagine that it can be stretched to 2 hours    but de palma manages to do that    it is not a very good achievement    as we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space   the hardest thing to do is stay awake    the film s major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is    david mamet s dialogue   while trying to seem natural   is distant and simply fake    de palma and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot    the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick s   2001   a space odyssey       apollo 13   and   godzilla      to make time pass   the creators have inserted several   refreshing   scientific details   that would not convince a half crazed frog    it consists of multiple copies and direct ripp offs from several great science fiction films and stories    when it finally presents an almost original idea   it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity    i can t even call this film predictable   since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this    sometimes it gets so cheesy   that you ll start laughing when you re supposed to cry and cry when you re supposed to laugh    you ll see enormous sandstorms   hear mysterious sounds and   last but not least   on this   constantly surprising   tour you ll see    an alien    it s really hard to find comparisons to such an experience   and i know that i ve never said that before   i thought i never would     but   lost in space   is actually better    that s an achievement in itself !  director brian de palma has stroke gold with   untouchables   that became an instant american classic    it is for this film that he will be remembered   while all his other failures will be forgotten    he ll live to fight another day !  i send the actors my condolences   since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters    and both the cinematography   production design and art direction are very decent    it is because of the achievement of 254 people   that i rate this film 2/10    unfortunately their hard work was in vain    if you have problems with insomnia   i recommend you this film    if you re not asleep within the first half hour   consult your doctor    
Neg, gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has a change of heart by the film s end and becomes a believer in god instead of a skeptic   going through an amazing transformation by having a christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who can now beat the devil by his faith alone       this is after two hours of throwing people out windows and shooting more people than your average serial killer    nobody can save this bomb from it s own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religious type of film    it s just a pile of dreck       an  ill conceived exploitive project   a pyrotechnical film       end of days   aims to be an apocalyptic thriller    it features an idiotic script   a hack director   and a one dimensional star who is past his prime       which  makes this film dumber than dumb   plus it s not funny   not campy   or is it in the least bit entertaining    it s just dreary and unwatchable       a  big budget slasher film    arnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan   occupying gabriel byrne s body and possessing a wall st   bank account   from destroying the world    the film opens in vatican city   roma 1979    where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso   looking out at the night sky and seeing a comet whiz by   who proclaims after looking at his scrolls    that s the sign for the  eye of god     which reveals that a child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satan s baby   the anti christ   in the hour before the new century begins   when satan will fuck her and open up the gates to hell on earth    tomaso has some twenty years to find this woman and save her and the world from doom    but some in the pope s circle want to kill her if found   even though the pope insists on having faith and letting her live   as he lectures them     even in the world s darkest days    doing evil doesn t stop evil   but brings on more evil      we saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979   which seems to be the  logical  place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries    the chosen woman is christine york   robin      it is now a few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wise cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall street turd   and when he is fired upon by a renograde priest   thomas aquinas   arnold saves him and through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot    he   nevertheless   can speak and tells arnold an  end of days  is coming as prophesized in revelations    but satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of  the end of the world  on his body    it is now up to arnold to save the world and find the chosen woman    he quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her   as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues   people jumping out of windows   satan taking a piss and dropping a match to kill arnold s partner as the piss explodes like gasoline   satan being fired at       resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain and sometimes nothing   as if the director forgot which way he wants to have it    there is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs    including the subway   churches   and luxury buildings    the only trouble with all these high budget action sequences   was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value    the story was so terrible and inaccurate   that it did not have an iota of value or credibility    mercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square   trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000    why is the end of 1999 considered to be the devil s number   666      well !          satan s numeral is actually   999      which is upside down of   666       accordingly   you just put a   1   in front of it   and bingo    you get   1999       with logic like that   this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewer s eyes and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult    this film should become a classic used by film schools in how not to make a horror film    i highly recommend seeing it for that purpose    
Neg, after enduring mariah carey s film debut   glitter   i m reminded of a bit from chris rock s bigger and blacker    in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man   rock says     you can drive a car with your feet   but that don t mean it should be done      to that i say   you can give mariah carey a movie   but that certainly don t mean it should be done    sure   there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there    from the beatles  a hard day s night to the spice girls  spice world    but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter    everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous    start off with the story   which    as gruesomely predictable as it is    is the least offensive part of the movie    the film is inexplicably set in the 80s   a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers    worse yet   everyone s speaking late 90s hip hop slang in what should be 1983    meant to be partially autobiographical   carey plays billie frank   a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother    influential club dj julian dice   a   k   a     lucky 7     max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro     hears her sing on a track   and decides to make her a star    in predictably rapid succession   billie and dice fall for each other   she starts hitting it big   dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass   and suddenly billie s on   the roller coaster of superstardom      in the meantime   billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom    i won t give away the ending   but    honestly    just think of unicorns and rainbows        you ll figure it out    the movie screams to be made with camp   and that could ve been fun    but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better    what a mistake    the brief attempts at comic relief    as in a scene where an effeminate russian sounding director gets wacky with filming billie s first music video    go over like lead balloons    instead   the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah s most dramatic scenes    which brings us to the performances   of which there s nothing good that can be said    mariah is primarily seen with a wide eyed deer in the headlights look frozen on her face    she actually looks scared during her one love scene    but you have to wonder if the writing isn t even worse    so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey s virginal target audience that it s probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb    even the characters couldn t have been written more absurdly    they re all members of a barbie playset   the important film director who swoons     billie   i d love to put you in a movie i m making     and the big time record executive who takes billie s demo tape and says     oh   i ll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning      everyone in the film is a device   and it s painful to keep watching just to see another one appear    to say more would be a waste    there s so much wrong with this film    and   it pains me that mariah carey    with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days   as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays    will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she s likely to get    but   then again   i had to suffer through her movie    
Neg, poster boy for co dependency needs patching  patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman  mediocrity is a pox on civilization    in our heavily consumer oriented society   there is an enormous demand to churn out   stuff      what would happen to our economy if we didn t feel the need to have more things    to make us buy more   businesses need to produce a ton of product    the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality    the film industry is like any other    in order for studios to survive   they have to make money    the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit    some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that   less talented people are used    there aren t enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary    for some reason   it s never crossed anyone s mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit    often   mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones    at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies    i m not suggesting that   patch adams   was tossed out just to rake in the bucks    my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel    it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story   but it s as dull as could be    hunter   patch   adams    robin williams   desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis    checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt   he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around    patch could be a poster boy for co dependency    he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesn t focus on his own problems    he decides that he wants to be a physician   leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia    as a med student   patch s antics at the school s hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch enemy   straight laced dean walcott   bob gunton      the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he s one of the top students    he writes in patch s academic file that he shows   excessive happiness      i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing    there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies    then it struck me    it must be based on a true story    the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute   a free clinic    robin williams is an amazing actor    while he is adept at dramatic roles   his forte is over the top free spirits    that s what makes his failure here so remarkable    patch is exactly the character he should be best at   yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat    something holds him back    most of the rest of the cast is two dimensional    for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings   it s curious that the ones here are cardboard characters    peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person    unfortunately he s in the film for only about two minutes    the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene    we re not left to our own emotional decisions   we re hit over the head with them    shaved headed children with cancer   an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh   a beautiful woman who can t love because of her abusive history    when a group of students fix up an old house to use as a clinic in the andy hardy   hey   let s put on a play !

Neg, young einstein is embarrassingly lame   but that didn t stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia   where it became the third largest box office hit of all time    in the u   s     warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan   inxs   and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under    personally   i m hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb    young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious   who not only wrote   produced   edited   and directed the film   but also starred and did his own stunts    his creation is about as stupid and contrived as you d expect from someone named yahoo    the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein s youth    whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany   the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania   a remote australian island    in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity   albert invents surfing   bubbles in beer   and the electric guitar    yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hick  a clown with an insatiable curiosity    although yahoo s performance is at first endearing   the one dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say e=mc2    yahoo has created a charming family for albert   and the scenes on tasmania are often clever    but after the first twenty minutes   the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy    young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot    yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack   unfortunately   the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing    almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video    the instrumental score   on the other hand   is generally playful   yahoo uses such classics as the   1812 overture   and the theme from the good   the bad and the ugly to great comic effect    halfway through young einstein   i knew for sure the movie was a stinker    but it wasn t until the very end that i finally put my finger on why   the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies   such as young sherlock holmes   but from cheesy prime time sitcoms    in fact   young einstein might have been more at home on network television   where its sophomoric humor wouldn t raise any eyebrows

Neg, one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek   the star of the wb s runaway hit dawson s creek    following in the foot steps of mtv s two other live action films   joe s apartment   1996   and dead man on campus   1998     varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace    set in west cannan   texas   the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john   mox   moxon   van der beek      we know he s smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook    coach bud kilmer   jon voight   has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him    the star quarterback   lance harbor   paul walker     is a handsome   blonde   hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader   darcy   ali larter      also on the team are an enormous guy   ron lester   with some health problems and the token african american team member   eliel swinton   whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin    when lance is seriously injured   mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it   undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies    his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend   jules   amy smart     is threatened and there s a big game at the end    guess who wins    nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love    there s a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow    van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes    also   the role isn t very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character    he s still a pseudo intellectual   whiny   nice guy   except here he also happens to be a jock    voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out    the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don t fare much better    on the positive side   walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville   1998      scott   son of james   caan has some lively moments as tweeder   the team s wild man    larter   as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas   gets to show off the film s most interesting costumes   including a very eye opening   whipped cream bikini      it s interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r rating with a lot of harsh language   alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity   including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise      all this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawson s creek   presumably the target audience for the picture    director brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger   from nickelodeon films   a sister company of mtv   and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression    the look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it    the football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out    there s an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul   foo fighters   green day and aaliyah but it s not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film    
Neg, susan granger s review of   america s sweethearts     columbia/sony    what a waste of a talented cast !  billy crystal and co writer peter tolan have concocted a sly   provocative premise and   as the opening credits roll   it s obvious that they re attempting an old fashioned romantic comedy    the story involves a veteran publicist   billy crystal   who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director   christopher walken   holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room   refusing to show it to anyone    he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film s once married but now estranged stars   gwen and eddie   catherine zeta jones   john cusack     they ll be so distracted that they won t remember they didn t see the movie or it wasn t what they expected       and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic/david manning quote scandal !    for help   he turns to gwen s personal assistant/sister   julia roberts      but the laughs are few and far between    crystal s glib   cynical flack isn t wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one liners    after six months under the care of a depak chopra like guru   alan arkin     cusack s character s too emotionally fragile   lacking the necessary charisma    zeta jones s vain   narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one dimensional    only hank azaria   as zeta jones s much macho spanish lover   and stanley tucci   as a studio exec   and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth    basically   we don t like these ego driven   stereotypical characters   let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements   and joe roth s direction is predictable   formulaic and telegraphic    on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10     america s sweethearts   is a contrived   shallow 4   as a screwball satire   it s strictly superficial

Neg, this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times    it is hard to tell what is independent about this film   it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam    it is the debut film for the director   who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults   a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s   where the mind set of all the characters depicted is grounded   but to see it in the 1990s is a different story   it is old news    the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn t mean much   since their relationship remained undeveloped    the introduction of the wise guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit   are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour de force performance by the star of the film   adrien brody as ray    ray is the only son of a low level mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield   new jersey   suburban basement    ray sr     vincent   is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale home repair business    his son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman   dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his long time waitress girlfriend joanne   sybil      the title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman 10b   which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film   you  should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don t make sense   its constant brainless chatter between the buddies   their uneventful growing pains   and the despair of their lives   make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them    desperate to make his dream come through   ray goes to a loanshark   humorously and menacingly played by james e   moriarty   and borrows 10 grand to bet on a   sure thing   at freehold raceway    the horse loses and now ray has big problems   as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough    there is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray    he is undependable   mean spirited   and stupid    so when his best friend mike   gallagher     the narrator of the film   gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriend  who cares    the director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do    as for ray s gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off   the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen    his buddies   the college student mike and the dependable butchie   gillan     and his old man   who he has this love/hate relationship with   rally to his aid    and the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity   that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films   as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together    there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting   though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star    because of his intensity and looks   he reminds me of sean penn    
Neg, come on hollywood   surprise me    stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue   sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset    the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls    personal   because his niece is one of the victims    it s a slobbering psychopath   of course   but this time there s a twist    freeman notes that each of the young women who ve disappeared are all strong willed   assertive   and more successful in their careers than the average girl    we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova   whose aim is to   dominate   these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem    anyway   one of the women manages to escape   ashly judd   and teams up with freeman to       well    you know the rest    a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs   with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants   may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story    perhaps   but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue    so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further   okay    and as for comparisons to seven       oh  please !  kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass    maybe the novel was a stinker to start with   but whatever the case   it s the writing that s clearly at fault here    one   these characters have very little to say that s engaging or interesting    two   the script has no sense of humour    three   while the notion of a psycho s victims being smart   successful women is an interesting twist   the execution isn t even half as good as the idea    thus   ashly judd comes across all out of focus   instead of being the heart of the story    we can t feel her rage    some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she s the no bullshit 90 s type   but these conversations barely register    and as for freeman   kiss the girls is his second dog in a year   first chain reaction   now this    for an actor of his calibre   this is most worrying    young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction esque things to do in denver when your dead    but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this    not much   and you can hardly blame him    there s a few well staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls   dives and jumps   and the effect is startling    but the script is beyond rescue    what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe   safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up    complacency rules   it s been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters   real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue    the only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie   positive proof that the best things in life aren t free
